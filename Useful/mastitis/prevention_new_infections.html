      <p>Control of the environment and reduction of exposure of the teat ends to causal organisms. </p>
      <h3> Environment </h3>
      <p> To reduce the exposure of teat ends to the mastitis causing organisms, keep the environment clean and dry. This simple concept of prevention can be very difficult to achieve. The demands on dairy farmers to manage labour to maintain a clean, dry environment for cattle competes with other needs of the dairy enterprise. Trends towards increased herd size, housing, greater milk production and genetic selection toward production and away from disease resistance are all modern dairy management realities. They work against steps to control environmental mastitis. Pastures can also pose exposure problems, especially after periods of excessive rainfall. Disinfectants and cleaning procedures cannot practically overcome massive environmental contamination. </p>

      <h3> Proper maintenance and function of milking equipment </h3>
      <p> The milking machine is integral to efficiency on a dairy farm and has direct contact with teats. It must perform properly and consistently every day, year after year. Milking systems should be installed following approved guidelines. Maintenance should be carried out regularly and machine function evaluated by scheduled periodic analysis of the system in a milking machine test. Each person involved in milking should thoroughly understand the components, function and operation of milking equipment. They should also be aware of the significance of regular equipment maintenance and of the importance of proper milking technique. Recommended vacuum levels and pulsation ratios and patterns must be maintained. Damaged rubber ware must be replaced immediately. Liners should be replaced at least twice per year or after each 2500 milkings. Service checks should occur every 6 months, or minimally annually, depending on the hours per day the system runs. </p>

            <h3>Regular teat disinfection with an effective disinfectant </h3>
      <p>              The objective of teat disinfection is to kill organisms residing on teats and thereby reduce the rate of new intramammary infections. Proper teat disinfection requires that teats are dipped or sprayed with a clean disinfectant solution immediately after milking ensuring that teat ends and lateral surfaces are well covered. Post-milking teat disinfection is proven to decrease new intra-mammary infections with contagious and to a lesser degree, environmental organisms. Post-milking teat disinfection must be done correctly and consistently to achieve its maximum impact. </p>

            <h3>              Using recommended milking procedures </h3>
      <p>              Milking hygiene is extremely important because of the potential interaction between milking machine function and bacteria on the teat skin. When attaching teat-cups the amount of air drawn into the milking system must be minimised. Too much air causes random vacuum fluctuations that can generate milk aerosol impacts on the teat end causing machine-induced infections. Cluster alignment should be adjusted as necessary during milking to prevent air entering the system (causing squawking) and cups dropping or being kicked off teats. Alignment also ensures that the quarters milk out properly. Once milking is completed in a cow, the vacuum to the milking unit should be shut off and the teat-cups removed. Removing the unit under vacuum causes milk and air to impact onto the teat ends. Cleaning and sanitising of the cups after every milking is important in reducing the number of mastitis-causing organisms and in maintaining milk quality. </p>

            <h3>              Personal hygiene of milkers </h3>
      <p>              Milkers are sometimes casual workers who may be inadequately trained in milk quality management. Milkers&rsquo; hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water and dried before milking begins. If hands become soiled during milking, they must be washed and dried again. Clean, dry, healthy hands minimize the spread of mastitis-causing organisms between cows. The wearing of milking gloves reduces transmission of mastitis causative agents. Milking uniforms must be as clean as possible. </p>

            <h3>              Water supply </h3>
<p>              Water sources, tanks, pipes, heaters and hoses may be become contaminated with environmental organisms such as coliforms, Pseudomonas sp, etc. Worn hoses and pipes should be replaced.<br>
              Preventative management of replacement, dry and lactating animals <br>
              Minimise social and management changes for heifers and cows near calving to minimise stress. Cows do not like change. </p>
              <a name="disinfect"></a>
            <div class="backtop"><a href="prevention.html#preventnew">Back to Index</a></div>
            <h3>              Replacement animals </h3>
      <p>              Heifers should calve &quot;clean&quot; of contagious intramammary infections due to a lack of exposure. However, some herds do have significant levels of infection in first calving heifers. The management of calves and yearlings influences mastitis occurrence in heifers. Treatment with antibiotics or teat sealants in all quarters of all heifers before parturition has been shown to decrease the prevalence of mastitis in heifers at calving. </p>
            <h3>              Dry cows </h3>
      <p>              Dry cow management strategies ideally should reduce the risk of infection from last milking until the next calving. The rate of new intramammary infections in untreated dry cows is expected to be between 8% and 12% of quarters. The objective of udder health management in the dry period is to minimise infected quarters at calving. Thus, infections present at the time of drying off should be eliminated and new intra-mammary infections during the dry period prevented. The focus of mastitis control schemes for the dry period is often on contagious pathogens but environmental bacteria need to be considered. Exposure to environmental pathogens appears to continue throughout the dry period making the prevention of new dry period infection with environmental organisms a considerable challenge. Some recent research data shows that daily or twice weekly application of post-milking teat disinfectants applied in the late dry period demonstrated considerable promise for controlling environmental infections. </p>
            <h3>              Lactating cows </h3>
      <p>              <strong>1. The Calving period.</strong> Maintenance of a clean environment is a key aspect of mastitis control during this period. Avoid excessive contamination of bedding material especially in wet weather. Cows close to calving should be separated from other cows. Clip or flame udder hair prior to calving. Use properly functioning milking equipment on fresh cows. Sucking by calves may spread infection from quarter to quarter or cow to cow and may also be a factor in spreading the disease to other calves if they are allowed to suck each other. </p>
            <h3>              Carefully introduce new animals to the herd </h3>
      <p>              Care should be taken when purchasing replacements. Many herds become newly infected by adding cows with infected udders. New arrivals should be sampled before joining the milking herd and should be milked separately until their infection status is determined. The RMT offers a quick and effective means of screening cows before admitting them to the milking herd. </p>
            <h3>              <a href="\">Dry cow therapy</a></h3>
            <h3>Management practices </h3>
      <p> Milking infected cows after the milking herd is an effective management practice that  reduces the exposure of the healthy udders to contagious organisms. If cows have access to feed following milking they remain standing which allows the teat end to dry and the teat canal to close completely. This helps avoid environmental contamination immediately after milking. Milking wet and/or dirty teats increases the risk of high bacterial counts in milk and also increases the probability of new IMI. </p>
            <h3>              Establish milking order and segregation program </h3>
      <p>              After detection of clinical mastitis case the cow should be drafted out and milked last. This is very effective in controlling the spread of contagious mastitis. Segregation is not a simple, single solution to contagious mastitis problems. Ideally first-lactation heifers, fresh cows and cows with low SCC should be milked first followed by cows with a high SCC, chronic clinical mastitis and finally current clinical cases. This will result in reduced chance of spreading mastitis-causing organisms from cow-to-cow. </p>
            <h3>              Increasing of resistance factors of the udder </h3>
      <h3>              Non-specific resistance factors</h3>
            <p> The teat sphincter is a primary physical barrier to infection. Once this defence is breached, secondary and less effective immune mechanisms are mobilised. Key to the secondary line of defence are neutrophils. Genetic variations in resistance to mastitis have been proven. One inherited characteristic which may affect susceptibility to mastitis is teat shape and cows with cylindrical teats become infected more commonly than cows with funnel-shaped teats. The shape of the teat end may also be important. Cows with pointed teat ends appear to have smaller diameter teat canal, and those with inverted, funnel-shaped ends, or with a recessed plate-like end appear to be more susceptible to infection. Other characters, which should be selected against are deep udders, excessively low hindquarters, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back and short wide teats. </p>
            <h3> Management of teat lesions</h3>
            <p> The ability of certain bacteria to colonise teat skin and thus be in a position to invade the mammary gland is documented. Teat lesions are common sites for such colonisation but few farmers appreciate their importance in mastitis control. Chapping of the teats is caused by wind, cold, wetness, sunburn and chemical irritation from teat sanitisers. Photosensitive dermatitis on the lateral aspects of light coloured teats, cowpox, pseudocowpox, bovine herpes mammillitis, black spot and papillomatosis are further common lesions. Treatment with a suitable antiseptic cream after each milking is recommended. lodophor teat disinfectant solutions containing 15% glycerine as an effective emollient assist the cure of sores and chapped teats. </p>
            <h3>              Specific resistance factors </h3>
            <p>              Vaccination.- Currently an effective vaccination programme is only available against E. coli mastitis in housed cows. </p>
            <h3> Concurrent disease </h3>
            <p> The increased incidence of diseases such as hypocalcaemia, ketosis and displaced abomasums are associated with an increased incidence of clinical mastitis. Thus, poorly managed nutrition of dry cows, pre-partum cows and cows in the first 60 days of lactation can adversely affect udder health. </p>
            <h3>              Nutrition </h3>
            <p>              Vitamin E, selenium and zinc supplements in diets appear to have a preventive effect against acute intramammary infections. </p>
