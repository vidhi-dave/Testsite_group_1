      <h1 class="center">Withholding Periods - Residues - Recording</h1>
    
    
      <p>All products that are registered for use in dairy cattle have the milk and meat withholding periods detailed on the label. Milk withholding period is the time the milk must be discarded after treatment. </p>
      <p> High penalties are imposed if farmers  have unacceptable levels &quot;inhibitory substances&quot; in milk supplied to the factory. The most common cause of inhibitory substance grades is the use of antibiotics, particularly following intramammary administration. </p>
      <p> The following recommendations should prevent contamination of bulk milk: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read the label before administering any drug to an animal. </li>
        <li>Treated cows must be clearly and consistently identified and run separately from the main milking herd. Record keeping (in the milking shed and in the farm records) is required. Marking of treated cows is advocated prior to treatment administration, to prevent unmarked cows jumping from the treatment unit and joining the main herd, thereby risking milk contamination. It is better to mark un-treated cow, than to milk treated cow into the vat.</li>
        <li>Treated cows should also be milked separately after the milk line has been diverted from the vat to, avoid contaminating bulk milk.</li>
        <li>Quarter milker and test bucket use to intercept contaminated milk from treated cows milked among the main herd is prohibited.</li>
        <li>	Registered withholding times are not applicable to &quot;off-label&quot; use of products. e.g. If more treatments are given than stated on the label, or if more than one quarter is treated, it is recommended to advise a longer withholding period. The combination of intra-mammary and systemic treatment is also considered as off-label use. Unfortunately the required withholding time is up to the discretion of the farmer or veterinarian. </li>
        <li>	Wash the plant with hot water after each milking. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite heavy penalties and recommendations to prevent residues, mistakes are common and milk contaminated with antibiotics finds its way into the vat. </p>
      <p> Most contamination is the result of human error e.g.: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> treated cows are not separated,</li>
        <li>treated cows escape into the herd where they are not recognised, </li>
        <li>the milk-line to the vat is not diverted before treated cows are milked.</li>
        <li>	Test-buckets are used ineffectively to intercept contaminated milk. </li>
        <li>	Non adherence to the prescribed withholding period.</li>
        <li>	Off-label use of antibiotics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cases have occurred where the source of contamination is less obvious: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple quarter treatments increasing required withholding periods. </li>
        <li>	Multiple cow treatments result in enough antibiotic reaching the vat after the end of the withholding period to fail an inhibitory substance test. Dilution does not always provide a solution to a problem. </li>
        <li>	Antibiotics carry-over in milk retained in the plant if washing is not adequate. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mastitis preparations for lactational and dry cow treatment also have meat withholding periods which are the period after treatment before which the animal cannot be slaughtered for human consumption. This is also applies to bobby calves. If a bobby calf is born within the meat withholding time of a product given to its dam, (unless it has a stated bobby calf withholding period) then it must be withheld from slaughter until the withholding period for the dam has elapsed. If a bobby calf drinks milk contaminated with antibiotics from a treated cow, then the calf must be withheld from slaughter and fed milk not containing antibiotics for seven days. </p>
      <p> It is a legal requirement and a requirement of supply to the dairy factory that all details of animal treatments are recorded by the farmer. Veterinarians have a significant role to play by transferring sufficient, accurate information and instructions to farmers about treatments given / to be given and withholding periods.<br>
