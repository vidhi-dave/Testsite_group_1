      <h1 class="center">Somatic cells in the milk</h1>
    
    
      <p>Cells in normal milk consist of 75-85 percent white blood cells that are predominantly neutrophils and 15-25 percent epithelial cells. Leukocyte numbers increase in response to bacterial infection, tissue injury and stress. Epithelial cells originate from udder secretory tissue and also increase as a result of injury or infection. Both cell types originate from within the cow&rsquo;s body and are called somatic or body cells. An increase in somatic cell numbers indicates an increase in the number of leucocytes. Neutrophils increase dramatically during infection to contribute up to 95% of the SCC. The concentration of somatic cells provides an indirect indicator that infection is occurring in a cow&rsquo;s mammary gland. Many herds that implement sound milking technique, hygiene and which control contagious mastitis have BTSCC of less than 100,000cells per ml. Milk with low SCC has a better taste and yields more cheese when used for cheese processing. Fonterra places a maximum limit of 400,000 cells per ml on bulk milk. Bulk milk exceeding this limit causes downgrading of milk quality and financial penalties for farmers. Most developed dairy countries have similar limits which are likely to be tightened in the future. </p>
      <h3><strong> Factors Affecting Somatic Cell Counts </strong></h3>
      <p> The correct interpretation of SCC data depends on an understanding of the factors that influence the number of cells in milk from a quarter, cow, or herd. Mastitis has the greatest effect on SCC. All the other factors that affect SCC are relatively unimportant. The interpretation of SCC data to monitor infection status requires knowledge and consideration of all factors affecting the SCC if it is to assist problem solving and decision-making mastitis control programs. </p>
      <p> Factors other than infection can cause substantial SCC increases. Chemical irritants, such as antibiotic therapy, can cause raised SCC. Trauma to the udder can also cause higher than normal SCC levels. The time and method of sampling may affect the resulting SCC value. For example, counts are lowest immediately before routine milking and are highest in stripping samples. Samples at evening milkings are somewhat higher than in the morning. There is considerable variation in SCC of  individual cows from day to day. Reasons for the observed variation include fluctuations in production, spontaneous elimination of infections, unobserved udder injury, stress and the inherent biological variation of individual cows. High SCC levels are abnormal and undesirable. </p>
      <p> Elevated SCC levels may result from several factors or a combination of them:</p>
      <h3> <strong>Cow age and stage of lactation </strong></h3>
      <p>        Two major factors affecting the SCC of individual cows are age and stage of lactation. SCC increases with advancing age and stage of lactation. This is because infection accumulates in older cows and within lactations when mastitis control is applied.  However, in herds that have a low prevalence of IMI by having effectively controlled spread of contagious organisms, there should be little evidence of changes in the SCC distribution with the age or stage of lactation. </p>
      <p> As cows become older, the SCC is generally higher as a result of an increased prevalence of subclinical infections with age, a greater cellular response to infections in older cows and increased residual damage from previous infections. If cows have never had mastitis there is no increase in SCC with age. </p>
      <p> Considerable variation in SCC occurs relative to the stage of lactation but there is no evidence that SCC fluctuates above 250,000 cells/mL throughout lactation, provided IMI does not occur. Greatly elevated counts are observed immediately after calving. Elevated SCC may occur in milk in late gestation and for a few weeks following calving, regardless of infection status. This SCC elevation appears to be part of a cow&rsquo;s natural immune system response in preparation for calving, to enhance the mammary gland defence mechanisms at this critical time. Quarters with no infections rapidly decline in SCC over8-14 days postpartum. Counts also rise just before drying off, as milk production decreases markedly, possibly caused by an increased prevalence of subclinical infections in later lactation. In a seasonal herd in which all cows are at the same stage of lactation the bulk milk cell count will normally be high in early lactation and just before drying-off. In late lactation, there is two-fold effect on the somatic cells, namely the decrease in milk volume and preparation of the mammary gland for involution. </p>
      <p> Once a day milking at the end of the season can result in a dramatic rise in herd bulk milk SCC as the volume suddenly drops and cells concentrate. Levels tend to readjust after a couple of days. However, the national penalty level of 400,000 cells/mL may be exceeded. Milking cows once a day is possibly a significant factor causing increased SCC levels towards the end of the season. </p>
      <h3><strong> Stress and season </strong></h3>
      <p> Overseas, bulk milk SCC monitoring programs show seasonal variation with higher cell counts in summer and early autumn than in winter or early spring. The stress of high temperatures and excess humidity or of sudden cold weather may increase the susceptibility of cows to new IMI and thus, higher SCC. Various stresses and oestrus have been implicated in causing increases in SCC. SCC changes in uninfected cows have modest or no effects whereas infected cows may cause a marked elevation in herd SCC. A sudden upset in the cow&rsquo;s routine, for example a herd blood test or pregnancy testing, can increase cell counts for a day or two. </p>
      <p> In New Zealand, the national bulk milk SCCs follow a U-shaped curve due to seasonal effects and the dynamics of Strep uberis and Staph aureus mastitis occurrence. </p>
      <h3> <strong>Oestrus</strong> </h3>
      <p>      Oestrous cows tend to have increased cell counts that are probably related to stress or milk volume changes. </p>
      <h3> <strong>Udder injury </strong></h3>
      <p>        Udder injury may temporarily elevate SCC in individual cows even without infection. Such instances usually are of short duration and improve as healing occurs. Damaged tissue is susceptible to infection so prevention of injury is important. </p>
      <h3> <strong>Indirect causes </strong></h3>
      <p>        Poor milking procedures contribute greatly to the incidence of IMI due to transmission of the disease at milking. Faulty milking equipment due to poor installation or maintenance can cause mammary tissue trauma, teat damage, poor milk-out, erratic vacuum levels, etc. Competent equipment personnel should conduct a complete system analysis at least twice per year. Chemical and other irritants can cause injuries to secretory tissue. Extraneous voltage causes cow apprehension, teat irritation, uneasiness and poor milk-out and elevated SCC. Technical factors, such as the method of transportation, use of preservatives, time in storage and type of cell counting instrument can affect SCC values to produce elevated SCC. </p>
      <h3> <strong>Intra-mammary infection</strong> </h3>
      <p>      IMI causes the greatest effect on SCC. Variation occurs in the SCC response elicited by various major organisms, yet it is not possible to distinguish among the organisms on the basis of SCC alone. Variations result from the number of quarters infected, the severity of infection in each quarter, the nature of the inflammatory response and the respective milk production of each quarter. The dilution of high SCC milk from infected quarters with low SCC milk from uninfected quarters is an important consideration when interpreting a composite sample cell count. An increased BTSCC is related to increased herd infection prevalence and decreased milk production. </p>
      <p> A few cows with acute Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis may elevate the bulk tank SCC greatly since large numbers of neutrophils tend to be produced in acute Streptococcus agalactiae infections. Contagious Staphylococcus aureus may be present in 50% or more of cows in the herd before the BTSCC reaches a level that causes alarm, which is a concern.</p>
