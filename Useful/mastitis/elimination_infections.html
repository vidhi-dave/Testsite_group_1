      <h1 class="center">Elimination of the existing infections</h1>
      <p>Complete elimination of mastitis from a herd is practically impossible in the medium term. Mastitis due to Streptococcus agalactiae can however be eradicated from individual herds. </p>
      <h2>        Lactating cow therapy </h2>
      <p>        The treatment of all clinical cases as they occur is mandatory. The treatment of subclinical cases should be delayed until the dry period. If a cow is heavy producer, is in early lactation and subclinically infected with Strep. agalactiae then treatment may be advisable. If the infection rate with Streptococci or Mycoplasma in the herd is high, treatment of subclinical cases to reduce the source of infection may be advantageous. If infection in the herd is predominantly with Staph. aureus, treatment of subclinical cases is generally not effective. Treatment options depend on the signs and causal agent. Usually local use of intramammary antibiotics is recommended. Supportive care is necessary in peracute and acute cases. </p>
      <p> Subclinical mastitis does not present an urgent threat to gland function or the life of the cow. Therapy is administered on the premise that treatment costs will be outweighed by compensatory production gains after elimination of infection but studies on the cost effectiveness of this approach do not support this. In the case of contagious organisms, elimination of infection may reduce the risk of new infections in previously non-infected cows. The degree of therapeutic success in treating subclinical mastitis relies predominantly on the type of causal organism and not often on the drug regimen selected. Parenteral in addition to intra-mammary therapy of chronic, subclinical intramammary infections may have the best probability of success.  Any therapy should be administered for long enough periods to ensure drug levels above the MIC in order to allow effective killing of the causal pathogens. However, the cure rates achieved may not be much better than those attained from spontaneous cure. Antimicrobial therapy is not recommended for subclinical intramammary infections in lactating cows except for treating Strep. agalactiae. </p>
      <h2>        Culling of chronically infected cows </h2>
      <p>        The maintenance of a high culling rate of senior cows with lumpy udders, or a history of repeated mastitis is probably one of the most important steps in mastitis control programs in herds where the prevalence of mastitis is high. Culling is an important means of decreasing the reservoir of infection particularly of contagious organisms. Individual treatment records and individual somatic cell count data is an important prerequisite for sound culling decisions. Quarters, which do not respond to treatment, should be permanently dried up or the affected cows culled. Culling is a very effective method of decreasing the prevalence of chronically infected cows. It must be done judiciously with respect to production, breeding performance, genetic potential and other health problems. Excessive culling to achieve quality milk premiums might have a negative financial impact on herds.<br>
