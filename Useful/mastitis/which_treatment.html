      <h1 class="center">Which milking cow treatment to choose in practice?</h1>
    
    
      <p>Many milking cow intramammary preparations are available in New Zealand. Fortunately for new veterinarians, most veterinary practices stock only a selection of these. Different drug companies produce mastitis preparations and many products have the same or similar active ingredients. </p>
      <p>See the <strong><a href="treat_pharmacology.html">Table of Milking Cow Preparations</a></strong></p>
      <p>The products available in New Zealand can be grouped into the following categories: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Penicillin </li>
        <li>Penicillin/ Aminoglycoside combination <br>
        </li>
        <li>Semi-synthetic penicillins <br>
        </li>
        <li>Semi-synthetic penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase blockers<br>
        </li>
        <li>Cephalosporins <br>
        </li>
        <li>Tetracycline <br>
        </li>
        <li>Lincomycin</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In some cases, groups are included in many products brands while some are only represented by a single product. Some products contain similar antibiotics in different concentrations or vehicles. These factors affect their persistence in the udder. Thus, the length of milk withholding periods may differ. </p>
      <p>The decision on which brands to stock is usually made by senior veterinarians in a practice based upon: <br>
        Knowledge of the pharmacology of drugs, <br>
        Knowledge and previous experience with particular mastitis preparations locally, <br>
        The availability of controlled clinical trials,<br>
        Culture and sensitivity results, <br>
        Preference for a drug company to deal with and<br>
        Cost. <br>
        Different veterinary practices prefer to use different products as first choice mastitis preparations and reserve some drugs to treat refractory cases. It is important that a new veterinarian in a practice familiarises themselves with stocked products and with the practice&rsquo;s protocols for the treatment of mastitis. </p>
      <p>Farmers are usually supplied with their regular mastitis preparations upon request, according to decisions made the time of PAR consultation. Veterinarians may not become involved in the treatment of mastitis unless the farm is experiencing a problem. Common presentations of farm problems are: animals are not responding to the regular preparation; there is a sudden increase in the clinical cases; high bulk milk somatic cell counts are occurring; and inhibitory substance grading is occurring. See dealing with problem herds. </p>
      <p>Remember though that intramammary antibiotics are prescription animal remedies that must only be supplied to bona-fide clients of a practice following consultation with a veterinarian. <br>
