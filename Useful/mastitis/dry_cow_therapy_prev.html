      <h1 class="center">Dry Cow Therapy</h1>
      <p> The dry period offers a valuable opportunity to eliminate intramammary infections while cows are not lactating. Thus the expense of discarded milk after therapy can be avoided, and with proper identification and segregation of dry cows out of the lactating herd, residues in marketed milk can be averted. In addition, once involution occurs 1 to 2 weeks after dry-off, the host defences of the mammary gland become markedly more effective in eliminating existing infections. The greatest increase in susceptibility is during the first 1-3 weeks of the dry period. In the early dry period the new intramammary infection rate is many times higher than during the preceding lactation as a whole. A second period of heightened susceptibility occurs just before parturition (during colostrogenesis). </p>
          <p>Dry cow therapy is carried out at the end of the last milking of the season, before the cow is dried off. The objective is to cure the infections carried over from the lactation period just terminated, and to protect the gland against new IMI, which are likely to occur during the dry period. This may be blanket treatment of all quarters, or selective treatment restricted to possibly infected quarters. Knowing which organisms are most prevalent in the herd will help to determine the most appropriate dry cow therapy. </p>

          <h3>Dry Cow Therapy is administered for three reasons: </h3>
          <ol type="i">
            <li> To treat existing sub-clinical intramammary infections. </li>
            <li>	To prevent new infections in the first 2-3 weeks after drying off. </li>
            <li>	To prevent clinical mastitis at parturition due to intramammary infections being carried over or acquired during the dry period. </li>
          </ol>
              <p>Cure rates are better with dry cow therapy than lactational therapy due to the length of exposure to the antibiotic. Also some cases self cure during the dry period due to enhanced immunological mechanisms active within the dry udder. </p>
              <p> A number of factors will influence a veterinarian&rsquo;s choice of dry cow therapy. </p>
              <p> See <a href="which_drycow_treatment.html"><strong>Which Dry Cow treatment to choose - in practice</strong></a></p>
              <p>Veterinarians are faced with many available products for dry cow therapy. </p>
              <p> See <a href="#"><strong>Table of Dry Cow Preparations</strong></a></p>
              <h3>The SAMM Plan outlines which cows to treat: </h3>
              <p> Cows with a somatic cell count of &gt; 150,000 at any herd test during the season. <br>
                Heifers with a somatic cell count of &gt; 120,000 at any herd test during the season. <br>
                Any cow which has had clinical mastitis during the last lactation.</p>
        <p>Treat the whole herd if: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> The Bulk tank cell count is &gt; 350,000 for most of the season </li>
                <li>                  Greater than 50% of the herd had one cell count of &gt; 150,000 (heifers 120,000) </li>
                <li>                  Greater than 10% of the herd had mastitis in the first month of lactation. </li>
                <li>                  If more than 15% of the herd had clinical mastitis in the first three weeks of the last dry period.  </li>
                <li>                  If the herd had a late season outbreak of clinical mastitis. </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Treatment procedure for Dry Cow Therapy. </h3>
              <p> At the last milking of the season: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Milk the udder out completely. </li>
                <li>                  Disinfect each teat end with 70% methylated spirit or chlorhexidine with cotton wool or a swab, starting with the furthest teats then the nearest teats to the operator. </li>
                <li>                  Insert the nozzle of the tube 2-3 mm into the teat canal then infuse the antibiotic working in the reverse order starting at the nearest teats so as not to contaminate these teats. </li>
                <li>                  Teat spray with a teat dip. </li>
                <li>                  Record all treatments. <br>
                  Withhold milk if the cow calves within the withholding time stated on the label. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Supportive treatments for drying-off.</p>
      <p>A product &quot;Teatseal<sup>TM</sup>&quot; is available on the New Zealand market. It is designed to occlude the teat cistern and teat canal, preventing  entry of bacteria into the udder after drying off. It remains in the teat until the first milking or  suckling by the calf. </p>
      <p> TEATSEAL IS NOT AN ANTI-MICROBIAL DRUG. </p>
      <p> There is evidence that it prevents new infections in the early dry and pre-calving periods but it does not treat existing infections. </p>
      <p>Teatseal should only be used to treat animals with individual cow somatic cell counts below 150,000 for cows and below 120,000 for heifers, i.e. un-infected animals. Other animals in the herd should be treated with antimicrobial Dry Cow Therapy. Use of a combination of DCT and Teatseal in the same quarter is being promoted but is expensive in view of a lack of consistent evidence of additional gains. </p>
      <p>The product is applied in the same manner as for Dry Cow Therapy. Note- the product must not be massaged up into the udder after infusion. Hygiene is critical at administration.</p>
      <p>Small amounts of the product may continue to be seen on the milk plant filter socks for some days after calving. They appear like small milk clots but can be identified by rubbing them between the thumb and fingers, where they form a bright white streak.<br>
