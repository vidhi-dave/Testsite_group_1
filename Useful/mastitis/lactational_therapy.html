      <h1 class="center">Lactational Therapy</h1>
      <p>The successful use of antimicrobial drugs for mastitis treatment depends on the same principles that apply to all microbial infections: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Selecting an effective antimicrobial, </li>
        <li> Attaining and maintaining therapeutic concentrations of the drug at the infection site for long enough, </li>
        <li> Minimising local or systemic side effects of therapy, and </li>
        <li> Administering supportive, non-antimicrobial therapy when indicated. </li>
      </ol>
       
          <p><br>
          Success of treatment is usually judged by the farmer as a return of milk and the udder to normal appearance (a clinical cure). This is not necessarily a bacteriological cure. </p>
      <p>Failure of bovine mastitis treatment is common despite an appropriate choice of antibiotic. </p>
      <p> Failure of treatment can be the result of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> An inability of the drug to reach and act on bacteria due to swelling in the udder, a walling-off of the infection or the intracellular nature of some pathogens. </li>
        <li>          Insufficient time of antibiotic exposure to the pathogen. </li>
        <li>          Bacterial resistance to the antibiotic used. </li>
        <li>          A veterinarian&rsquo;s choice of drug results from a variety of factors. <br>
          <br>
          See <a href="lact_which_treatment.html">Which Milking Cow treatment to choose</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A wide variety of antibiotics are available for lactational therapy that are formulated and packaged to be administered through the teat canal. </p>
      <p> See <a href="which_treatment.html">Table of Milking Cow Preparations</a>.</p>
      <p>All intra-mammary antibiotics have registered withholding periods. This is the time for which the milk must be discarded following the last treatment. The discarded milk is a major visible (to the farmer) cost in the treatment of mastitis. A short withholding period is therefore desirable in order to return the milk back to the bulk supply more quickly and to reduce the chance of accidentally directing milk to the bulk supply during the withholding period. The length of the withholding period must be balanced against the need for the antibiotic to be present in the treated quarter long enough to effect a cure (clinical or bacteriological). Some very short with-holding time products have lost popularity due to poor efficacy. </p>
      <p>See <a href="withholding.html">Withholding Times - Residues - Recording</a>. </p>
      <p> Heavy penalties for inhibitory substances grades, have lead to voluntary extension of the prescribed withholding periods for products by some farmers to preclude any chance of a penalty.</p>
      <h2>Treatment procedure for intra-mammary therapy </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Milk the udder out completely. </li>
        <li>          Disinfect the teat end with cotton balls dampened in alcohol or teat wipes. </li>
        <li>          Insert the nozzle of the tube 2-3 mm into the teat canal (so as not to introduce any new contaminants through the teat canal) then infuse the antibiotic. </li>
        <li>          Massage the antibiotic into the quarter. </li>
        <li>          Teat dip or spray. </li>
        <li>          Identify the animal and record all treatments. </li>
        <li>          Run treated animals separately from the herd to reduce their chance of being milked into the vat. </li>
        <li>          Observe the withholding period. </li>
        <li>          Complete a full course of antibiotics as stated on the label,  even if a clinical cure is apparent before the end of the course of therapy. The longer the course of treatment, the more likely is a bacteriological cure. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Parenteral antimicrobial therapy for mastitis</h2>
      <p>Occasionally parenteral therapy is indicated for mastitis, including for: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Systemically sick cows, </li>
        <li>          Severely swollen udders - proper diffusion of intramammary preparations is likely to be impaired, </li>
        <li>          When a cow is aggressive and it is impossible to administer an antibiotic by the intra-mammary route, </li>
        <li>          When multiple quarters are infected and it is more cost effective to use injectable antimicrobials. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In some cases both, intramammary and parenteral treatment are advocated, particularly if cows have very swollen udders and are systemically ill.          </p>
          <h2>Supportive treatment for clinical mastitis</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete milking out of quarters at least twice daily. </li>
            <li>              Injectable Oxytocin (20iu) may facilitate complete milking out. </li>
            <li>              Injectable NSAID's are useful in swollen quarters. </li>
            <li>              Fluid therapy is indicated in cases of toxic mastitis.</li>
