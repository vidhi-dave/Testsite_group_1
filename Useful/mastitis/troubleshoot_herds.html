      <h1 class="center">Troubleshooting problem herds</h1>
    
    
      <p>Veterinarians have a major role to play in planning mastitis control and managing milk quality using the any tools available. Collection of complete data to help understand the farm and its problems, identification of causative organisms and introduction of a preventive medicine approach as part of a cattle health plan tailored to the individual farm help control. Udder health supports profitable milk production. There are significant losses from poor udder health and also significant penalties for failing to achieve minimum levels of milk quality. With this economic background, the control of udder health has never been more important and the margin for error is minimal. Achieving high production of quality milk is a challenge, as a missed procedure in mastitis control or the hygiene routine may produce significant costs. </p>
      <p> Veterinarians usually become involved in troubleshooting problem herds in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The milk processing plant reports a higher than permissible bulk tank somatic cell count. </li>
        <li>	The herd experiences a higher-than-normal incidence of clinical mastitis or there are many recurrent cases.</li>
        <li>	The milk processing plant reports milk quality problems such as a higher than permissible total bacterial count, higher than permissible concentrations of inhibitory substances, etc. </li>
        <li>The herd experiences a higher than normal incidence of teat lesions. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> The procedure for response is the same in all these situations. </p>
      <p> Such concerns should be treated as an emergency and reorganising daily duty rosters is often indicated. </p>
      <p> Not all clients telephone their practice to seek advice when they develop high cell count problems in the herd. Many farmers persevere in managing a disease problem alone before eventually calling in help. High levels of culling and treatment can be seen the norm, rather than be seen as unacceptable and requiring investigation. Dairy farmers can fail to understand the true costs of mastitis and they may hold a false perception of the high costs of investigation. </p>
      <h2> Herd investigation </h2>
      <p> The procedure is the same in all herd investigations, regardless of the problem and consists of: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>        Taking history and collecting data<br>
          </li>
        <li>Conducting a herd visit<br>
          </li>
        <li>Diagnosing the problem, its&rsquo; causes and predisposing factors<br>
          </li>
        <li>Recommending appropriate control measures<br>
          </li>
        <li>Monitoring progress </li>
      </ol>
      <p>        History taking and collecting data </p>
      <p> There are many history taking forms available from different sources (e.g. Countdown downunder investigation pack). Specific questions should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 	When did the problem start? <br>
          </li>
        <li>How it was discovered?<br>
  </li>
        <li>Are measures to control the problem already in place and who implements them?<br>
  </li>
        <li>Did any management or other changes occur on the farm prior to the problem appearing?<br>
  </li>
        <li>What are the normal management procedures etc.? <br>
  </li>
        <li>It is necessary to find out if other parties are involved in the case before your investigation is started. There may be company personnel, milk quality specialists, a milking machine technician, teat disinfectant producers and drug sales or similar companies already involved in the problem. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>        Concurrently with taking the history it is necessary to seek information from the herd owner such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>	individual cow somatic cell counts (Hard copies or Minda access), <br>
        </li>
        <li>bulk tank somatic cell counts (tanker dockets, Fonterra&rsquo;s monthly reports or Fencepost.com access), <br>
  </li>
        <li>milk plant quality reports (tanker dockets, Fonterra&rsquo;s monthly reports or Fencepost.com access), <br>
  </li>
        <li>laboratory culturing results, <br>
  </li>
        <li>records of the occurrence and treatment of mastitis (farm records and sales of drugs from the vets), <br>
  </li>
        <li>records of purchased mastitis and dry cow products, <br>
  </li>
        <li>culling records, <br>
  </li>
        <li>milking machine test reports, etc.       </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>Owners and all staff involved in milking should be interviewed to ask each one their opinion of the cause of the problem. This will help to discover management problems or other system failures which may be overlooked or hidden by the person answering if only one person is interviewed. Careful discussion with milking staff on the criteria for diagnosing mastitis and what treatment protocols have been applied on the farm is necessary. Sometimes a change in incidence of mastitis in the herd is more a reflection of a change in the criteria of case selection than a real change in incidence. A milker can over diagnose the occurrence of clinical mastitis and embark on a campaign of treatment which will effect results. Alternatively, there may be no system in place to diagnose mastitis. </p>
      <h2> Herd visit </h2>
      <p> Visiting the herd during milking reveals many problems apparent only when the milkers and the milking systems and procedures are operating, such as factors associated with milking machines, teat damage, cow flow/behaviour and teat disinfection. An initial visit may only identify which cows are affected, which procedures or milking machine problems are predisposing factors and if any other factors are involved. The sequence of observations and the specific tasks to be carried out depends on the problem. Observation, palpation, fore-stripping, RMT testing, collection of milk samples for culture aseptically &plusmn; sensitivity testing or other procedures may be required. Usually a milk downgrading problem is associated with less than 10% of the cows. Identification and removal of high SCC cows from supply until the problem is solved is a good start. There may be time to observe other aspects of milking and pertinent environmental factors. A recording of observations and all findings is essential. </p>
      <p> At a Second visit may be necessary, where staff are not distracted by identification and drafting of affected cows. During the second visit the cow&rsquo;s total environment must be observed. To discover the unusual milking procedures is advisable to keep a distance for some time from the milkers, to let them relax and start with their normal milking behaviour. Many problems may be discovered only in this way, such as cups handling, under- and over- milking, incorrect disinfection post milking, etc. This is usually done during the second visit, because the first visit is aiming to discover cows causing the problem. </p>
      <p> If there is a high incidence of teat lesions the need for good light is essential. A head torch is ideal. Teats may be assessed by visualisation and palpation. Taking photographs may be invaluable for later discussion with the owner and for follow up purposes. </p>
      <h2>        Diagnosis of the problem, causes and predisposing factors </h2>
      <p>        There rarely is a single reason for a mastitis problem. The cause of the problem is usually multi-factorial and can be established in many cases on the basis of the history, herd data and herd visit. Ideally all predisposing factors and causes of the problem will be identified but this may not always be possible. A partial list of causes will help in the next step of the problem-solving procedure. The causal diagnosis may cover the organisms involved, their source, milking machine malfunction, milking management issues, the age structure of the herd and under- or over- diagnosis of clinical mastitis by herd staff. </p>
      <p> Possibly the most difficult scenario occurs when a management change happened so long ago that most people do not associate it with a current mastitis problem. Unfortunately this scenario is one of the most common occurring in a troubleshooting visit. An example is that farmers do not associate a mastitis problem with ceasing teat disinfection, as current procedures may have been in place for a year or more before the cumulative effect finally results in BTSCC grades.<br>
      To establish the extent of the problem requires a study of mastitis records, intramammary usage and cell count data. These records, combined with a knowledge of the farm, will often indicate areas of weakness. </p>
      <p> Mastitis may be linked to other management problems. For example, a farmer may be unable to cull chronically infected cows because of high number of non-pregnant cows due to poor reproductive performance (which is very common in practice). Another example occurs when investigating a mastitis problem it is found that a high lameness incidence is associated with low quality races etc. </p>
      <h2> Recommendation of appropriate control measures </h2>
      <p> Any diagnosis should be communicated to the herd owners and all milking personnel. In an emergency situation (to solve grading problems) this may be initially done verbally or using a self-carboning book that is used to make notes in while on the farm. </p>
      <p> A final written report should be sent within a few days that describes and documents in detail all findings and recommendations. The report should be concise and written in easily understandable language, acceptable for the herd owners and milking personnel. </p>
      <p> Removal of affected cows from supply will lead to removal of the penalties and then it is important to prepare an action plan for these affected cows. Problem herds that experience an unacceptable rate of clinical mastitis are more problematic than herds with high BTSCC because clinical signs are often transitory. Any affected quarters are treated with antibiotics and although a clinical cure will satisfy the farmer it may not necessarily result in a microbial cure or sufficient drop in somatic cell count. A milk sampling scheme to secure milk samples from quarters with clinical mastitis prior to any therapy should be implemented.  Herds in need of troubleshooting have often shuffled resources to other endeavours and require an immediate response to remain legal or profitable. Many recommendations can be made without the aid of microbial culturing, but with no information on causative agents the risk of error is such that the problem may persist or even exacerbate. </p>
      <p> Recommendations depend on the causes and predisposing factors. In cases with a high prevalence of teat lesions, or where penalties apply due to a milk quality issue, changes in management and procedures may lead to resolution of the problems. </p>
      <h2> Monitoring progress </h2>
      <p> On-going monitoring is indicated and recommendations may change as the problem resolves. Short-term problem solving without adequately addressing underlying factors provides limited relief and will lead to a decreased trust by the farmers of their veterinarians. </p>
      <p> Efforts need to be spent investigating problem herds in order to achieve prevention of new infections rather than just dealing with the consequences of previous inadequacies. </p>
      <p> To achieve the higher standards being demanded of milk suppliers, an improved level of management, vigilance and attention to detail is required. This can be difficult to achieve as it involves an increased workload. </p>
      <p> As subclinical infections become more relevant financially the use of the Rapid Mastitis Test, individual cow cell counts and quarter cell counts become more important in monitoring udder health. Early detection of infection, before visual changes occur in the milk, is currently difficult to achieve. There needs to be a better indication of the SCC of milk before it enters the tank which currently is not easily achieved.</p>
