      <h1 class="center">Which dry cow treatment to choose in practice?</h1>
      <p>        There are a variety of dry cow therapy products on the market. </p>
      <p> See the <a href="dry_preps.html">Table of Dry Cow Preparations </a></p>
      <p> These largely belong in the penicillin, semi-synthetic penicillin or cephalosporin categories or any of these combined with an aminoglycoside. </p>
      <p> Dry cow preparations contain similar anti-microbial drugs to milking cow preparations but are formulated in slow release bases and as organic salts that ensure persistence of antibiotic in the udder. </p>
      <p> Dry cow treatments are categorised according to their persistence in the udder. Most &quot;short acting&quot; dry cow therapies claim that antimicrobial levels in the udder exceed MIC's for common pathogens for about 4-5 weeks. &quot;Long acting&quot; dry cow therapy preparations claim up-to ten weeks of activity. </p>
      <p> Decisions on which brands are stocked by veterinary practices are usually made by senior veterinarians in a practice. Choices are made upon similar criteria as for milking cow treatments and veterinary practices stock short and long acting options. </p>
      <p> The use of a product on a particular farm is based upon:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Past experience of the farmer / vet. </li>
        <li>	Results of culture and sensitivity tests done during the season. </li>
        <li>	Length of action of the drug. </li>
        <li>	Cost to farmer. </li>
        <li>	Due calving dates </li>
      </ul>
      <p>        All products are similarly effective at preventing clinical mastitis in the three weeks after drying-off. </p>
      <p>        Some products appear better suited to treat existing intra-mammary infections depending upon the bacteria involved and the MIC for the antibiotic. Since we cannot economically culture the milk of all cows, an informed choice must be made based on the history of the farm and culture results to decide which drugs are appropriate. </p>
      <p>        e.g. A penicillin product is not well suited for a farm with a history of a Staphylococcus aureus problem based on the in-vitro sensitivity of this bacteria since it has a likelihood of developing beta lactamase resistance. In contrast, such a product is likely to be effective against streptococci. </p>
      <p>        Longer acting preparations are able to reduce the acquisition of infections late in the dry period which may cause clinical mastitis in the peri-calving period. Their efficacy in this regard has been shown to be lower than of Teatseal. </p>
      <p>        Most milking cow preparations are similarly priced, but the price of Dry Cow Therapy products varies considerably according to the length of udder persistence. Cost is an important factor to consider, especially when large numbers of cows are to be treated. </p>
      <p>        It is important to consider the due calving dates when choosing Dry Cow Therapy. Do not choose a product if the cow is due to calve within the withholding time or residues in the milk may result. If a cow calves within the withholding time of a product, her milk must be withheld from supply until the withholding time has elapsed or until the milk is demonstrated to be free of residues. </p>
      <p>        Dry Cow Therapy products are prescription animal remedies which can only be supplied to bona-fide clients following a veterinary consultation. An approved protocol for the supply of Dry Cow Therapy is promoted by the veterinary council of New Zealand. It involves annual DCT consultation which gives an excellent opportunity to review the current season and plan for the next. </p>
