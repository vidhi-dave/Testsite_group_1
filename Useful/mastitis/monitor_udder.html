      <h1 class="center">Monitoring of udder health</h1>
      <p>A policy to detect or select subclinical infections is needed for selective dry cow therapy to be practiced. Another monitoring need in mastitis control is to identify the organisms infecting quarters. </p>
      <h3>        Somatic cell count program </h3>
      <p>        This comprises checks available at the herd, cow and quarter levels. </p>
      <h3>        Herd level </h3>
      <p>        This is done by means of a bulk tank somatic cell count. It indicates herds with mastitis problems. </p>
      <h3>        Cow level </h3>
      <p>        Cow-side tests or in-line electronic equipment can examine the milk of individual cows relatively economically. Monitoring SCC scores, particularly at dry off and calving can monitor mastitis control effectiveness.  Individual cow somatic cell counts are useful guides for treatment and culling decisions. </p>
      <h3>        Quarter level </h3>
      <p>        Collection and examination of milk from all quarters of each cow, is usually arranged after individual cows have been identified as probably infected by a cow level check. Such checking provides more accurate data for assessing the mastitis status of individual cows. </p>
      <h3>        Regular viewing and palpation of the udder </h3>
      <p>        Diagnosis of mastitis in a non-lactating heifer, or cow, is not at an ideal time for treatment but adds to control. The simplest method is to palpate each quarter to detect differences between them. Infected quarters are usually swollen and firmer than non-infected quarters. Apparently infected quarters can be sampled for bacteriological testing. </p>
      <p> Evaluation of teat condition on a regular basis to determine effects of equipment, system settings, teat sanitizers and the weather is important in mastitis control. Cows kept in warm, dry conditions have few if any significant changes to teat skin condition over the year. </p>
      <p>        <a href="#">CMT or other cow side tests for detection of mastitis</a> </p>
      <h3>        Bacteriological culture to identify organisms </h3>
      <p>        Culture of milk samples from representative cows in the herd, including all cows when they show clinical mastitis, cows with high SCC and cows with chronic mastitis, allows bacteria causing mastitis to be identified and monitored. This knowledge can assist in determining the causes of mastitis and in developing further control strategies.   Antimicrobial sensitivity testing should be included to determine if antibiotic resistance in bacteria is occurring for lactating ordry cow treatments. </p>
      <h3>        Record keeping </h3>
      <p>        The cow number, date, quarter infected and treatment must be recorded for cases of mastitis. Summaries of these records monthly and annually allow herd mastitis control to be monitored.  These records can guide management and treatment decisions, such as cows to cull and treat with dry cow products. </p>
      <h3> Useful online links</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.countdown.org.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Countdown Downunder</strong></a></p>
      <p>The national mastitis and cell count control program is an Australian initiative to help farmers there reduce cell counts and improve milk quality.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://www.countdown.org.au/news/grabs/march01/01mar_1_grabs.htm" target="_blank"><strong>The Golden Rules of drying-off</strong></a></p>
      <p>All cows need an effective dry period to heal existing udder infections and to maximise milk production in their next lactation. Drying-off can best be achieved by following the 3 golden rules: <br>
        Stop Seal and Heal... </p>
      <p>for details visit their website  <a href="http://www.countdown.org.au" target="_blank">http://www.countdown.org.au</a> </p>
      <p> It is very good source of information on mastitis control. A part of the recommended procedures is a requirement to check if targets that are set are achieved. This differentiates Countdown Downunder from other mastitis control programmes and shows  the characteristics of a true herd health approach. <br>
