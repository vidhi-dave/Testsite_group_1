   The treatments available for mastitis can be broadly divided into those used to treat clinical mastitis during the <strong><a href="#lact">lactation</a></strong> and those administered after the last milking to provide a persistent source of antibiotic in the udder during the <strong><a href="#dry">dry period</a></strong>. </p>
 
<p>A variety of drugs that behave differently in the udder are incorporated into products available for dairy cattle. </p>

      <h1>Lactational Therapy</h1>
      <p>The successful use of antimicrobial drugs for mastitis treatment depends on the same principles that apply to all microbial infections: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Selecting an effective antimicrobial, </li>
        <li>Attaining and maintaining therapeutic concentrations of the drug at the infection site for long enough, </li>
        <li>Minimising local or systemic side effects of therapy, and </li>
        <li>Administering supportive, non-antimicrobial therapy when indicated. </li>
      </ol>
      <p><br>
        Success of treatment is usually judged by the farmer as a return of milk and the udder to normal appearance (a clinical cure). This is not necessarily a bacteriological cure. </p>
      <p>Failure of bovine mastitis treatment is common despite an appropriate choice of antibiotic. Failure of treatment can be the result of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> An inability of the drug to reach and act on bacteria due to swelling in the udder, a walling-off of the infection or the intracellular nature of some pathogens. </li>
        <li> Insufficient time of antibiotic exposure to the pathogen. </li>
        <li> Bacterial resistance to the antibiotic used.</li>
      </ul> 
      
     <a name="whichmilk"></a>
     
     
     
      <p>A veterinarian&rsquo;s choice of drug results from a variety of factors.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>        <strong>See <a href="lact_which_treatment.html">Which Milking Cow treatment to choose</a></strong>. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <a name="tablemilk"></a> 
     <p>A wide variety of antibiotics are available for lactational therapy that are formulated and packaged to be administered through the teat canal.</p>
     <blockquote>
       <p>      <strong>See <a href="milking_preps.html">Table of Milking Cow Preparations</a></strong>.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <a name="withh"></a>
      <p>All intra-mammary antibiotics have registered withholding periods. This is the time for which the milk must be discarded following the last treatment. The discarded milk is a major visible (to the farmer) cost in the treatment of mastitis. A short withholding period is therefore desirable in order to return the milk back to the bulk supply more quickly and to reduce the chance of accidentally directing milk to the bulk supply during the withholding period. The length of the withholding period must be balanced against the need for the antibiotic to be present in the treated quarter long enough to effect a cure (clinical or bacteriological). Some very short with-holding time products have lost popularity due to poor efficacy.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>        <strong>See <a href="withholding_periods.html">Withholding Times - Residues - Recording</a></strong>. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>      Heavy penalties for inhibitory substances grades, have lead to voluntary extension of the prescribed withholding periods for products by some farmers to preclude any chance of a penalty.</p>
      <h2>Treatment procedure for intra-mammary therapy </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Milk the udder out completely. </li>
        <li> Disinfect the teat end with cotton balls dampened in alcohol or teat wipes. </li>
        <li> Insert the nozzle of the tube 2-3 mm into the teat canal (so as not to introduce any new contaminants through the teat canal) then infuse the antibiotic. </li>
        <li> Massage the antibiotic into the quarter. </li>
        <li> Teat dip or spray. </li>
        <li> Identify the animal and record all treatments. </li>
        <li> Run treated animals separately from the herd to reduce their chance of being milked into the vat. </li>
        <li> Observe the withholding period. </li>
        <li> Complete a full course of antibiotics as stated on the label,  even if a clinical cure is apparent before the end of the course of therapy. The longer the course of treatment, the more likely is a bacteriological cure. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Parenteral antimicrobial therapy for mastitis</h2>
      <p>Occasionally parenteral therapy is indicated for mastitis, including for: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Systemically sick cows, </li>
        <li> Severely swollen udders - proper diffusion of intramammary preparations is likely to be impaired, </li>
        <li> When a cow is aggressive and it is impossible to administer an antibiotic by the intra-mammary route, </li>
        <li> When multiple quarters are infected and it is more cost effective to use injectable antimicrobials. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In some cases both, intramammary and parenteral treatment are advocated, particularly if cows have very swollen udders and are systemically ill. </p>
      <h2>Supportive treatment for clinical mastitis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete milking out of quarters at least twice daily. </li>
        <li> Injectable Oxytocin (20iu) may facilitate complete milking out. </li>
        <li> Injectable NSAID's are useful in swollen quarters. </li>
        <li> Fluid therapy is indicated in cases of toxic mastitis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Dry Cow Therapy</h1>
      <p> The dry period offers a valuable opportunity to eliminate intramammary infections while cows are not lactating. Thus the expense of discarded milk after therapy can be avoided, and with proper identification and segregation of dry cows out of the lactating herd, residues in marketed milk can be averted. In addition, once involution occurs 1 to 2 weeks after dry-off, the host defences of the mammary gland become markedly more effective in eliminating existing infections. The greatest increase in susceptibility is during the first 1-3 weeks of the dry period. In the early dry period the new intramammary infection rate is many times higher than during the preceding lactation as a whole. A second period of heightened susceptibility occurs just before parturition (during colostrogenesis). </p>
      <p>Dry cow therapy is carried out at the end of the last milking of the season, before the cow is dried off. The objective is to cure the infections carried over from the lactation period just terminated, and to protect the gland against new IMI, which are likely to occur during the dry period. This may be blanket treatment of all quarters, or selective treatment restricted to possibly infected quarters. Knowing which organisms are most prevalent in the herd will help to determine the most appropriate dry cow therapy. </p>
      <a name="drycow"></a>
      <h3>Dry Cow Therapy is administered for three reasons: </h3>
      <ol type="i">
        <li> To treat existing sub-clinical intramammary infections. </li>
        <li> To prevent new infections in the first 2-3 weeks after drying off. </li>
        <li> To prevent clinical mastitis at parturition due to intramammary infections being carried over or acquired during the dry period. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Cure rates are better with dry cow therapy than lactational therapy due to the length of exposure to the antibiotic. Also some cases self cure during the dry period due to enhanced immunological mechanisms active within the dry udder. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> A number of factors will influence a veterinarian&rsquo;s choice of dry cow therapy.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>          <strong>See <a href="which_drycow_treatment.html">Which Dry Cow treatment to choose - in practice</a></strong><a href="which_drycow_treatment.html">.</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Veterinarians are faced with many available products for dry cow therapy.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>          <strong>See <a href="dry_preps.html">Table of Dry Cow Preparations</a></strong><a href="dry_preps.html">.</a></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>The SAMM Plan outlines which cows to treat: </h3>
      <p> Cows with a somatic cell count of &gt; 150,000 at any herd test during the season. <br>
        Heifers with a somatic cell count of &gt; 120,000 at any herd test during the season. <br>
        Any cow which has had clinical mastitis during the last lactation.</p>
      <p>Treat the whole herd if: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The Bulk tank cell count is &gt; 350,000 for most of the season </li>
        <li> Greater than 50% of the herd had one cell count of &gt; 150,000 (heifers 120,000) </li>
        <li> Greater than 10% of the herd had mastitis in the first month of lactation. </li>
        <li> If more than 15% of the herd had clinical mastitis in the first three weeks of the last dry period. </li>
        <li> If the herd had a late season outbreak of clinical mastitis. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Treatment procedure for Dry Cow Therapy. </h3>
      <p> At the last milking of the season: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Milk the udder out completely. </li>
        <li> Disinfect each teat end with 70% methylated spirit or chlorhexidine with cotton wool or a swab, starting with the furthest teats then the nearest teats to the operator. </li>
        <li> Insert the nozzle of the tube 2-3 mm into the teat canal then infuse the antibiotic working in the reverse order starting at the nearest teats so as not to contaminate these teats. </li>
        <li> Teat spray with a teat dip. </li>
        <li> Record all treatments. <br>
          Withhold milk if the cow calves within the withholding time stated on the label. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Supportive treatments for drying-off.</p>
      <p>A product &quot;Teatseal<sup>TM</sup>&quot; is available on the New Zealand market. It is designed to occlude the teat cistern and teat canal, preventing  entry of bacteria into the udder after drying off. It remains in the teat until the first milking or  suckling by the calf. </p>
      <p> <strong>Teatseal IS NOT an anti-microbial drug</strong>. </p>
      <p> There is evidence that it prevents new infections in the early dry and pre-calving periods but it does not treat existing infections. </p>
      <p>Teatseal should only be used to treat animals with individual cow somatic cell counts below 150,000 for cows and below 120,000 for heifers, i.e. un-infected animals. Other animals in the herd should be treated with antimicrobial Dry Cow Therapy. Use of a combination of DCT and Teatseal in the same quarter is being promoted but is expensive in view of a lack of consistent evidence of additional gains. </p>
      <p>The product is applied in the same manner as for Dry Cow Therapy. Note- the product must not be massaged up into the udder after infusion. Hygiene is critical at administration.</p>
      <p>Small amounts of the product may continue to be seen on the milk plant filter socks for some days after calving. They appear like small milk clots but can be identified by rubbing them between the thumb and fingers, where they form a bright white streak.</p>
