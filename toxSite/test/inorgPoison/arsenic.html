<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Arsenic was once a very common cause of poisoning in farm animals and pets in NZ. In recent years the incidence has declined due to the marked reduction in the use of arsenical compounds, the banning of arsenical sheep dips, and the replacement of arsenical orchard sprays, herbicides and other pesticides with more effective materials. Nevertheless arsenic has been a constant source of poisoning to both humans and domestic animals. Arsenic leaching into ground water from copper-chrome-arsenic treated fenceposts is currently causing concern.</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>Arsenic exists in two forms; grey or metallic arsenic which is very stable and a metalloid form or yellow arsenic. Metallic arsenic exists in three oxidative states; elementary, trivalent (arsenite) and pentavalent (arsenate). Arsenical compounds are widely distributed in nature and can be found in soils and ores mainly as sulphides.</p>
<p>Natural sources of arsenic are arsenical pyrites (FeS2 FeAs2), the sulphates, realgar (As2S3) and orpiment (As2S3). Soils in the thermal regions of New Zealand have particularly high arsenical concentrations, and mud from the Waiotapu valley has been shown to contain as much as 2% of arsenic. Disturbances to the top layer of these soils, as in post hole digging, may allow puddles of water to accumulate in the underlying soil layers which contain toxic levels of arsenic.</p>
<p>During the roasting of metallic ores as well as in the production of arsenic, arsenic trioxide is produced and may be carried as a dust to contaminate soil, herbage and water.</p>
<p>Arsenic trioxide is the most commonly used arsenical compound and being an amorphous or crystalline, white, tasteless powder its resemblance to flour and chalk has lead to many fatal poisonings. It was once used in New Zealand as a rabbit and rat poison but its main use now is as a hide dressing, which contains 50% W/V of As2O3 (Trade name Peltex).</p>
<p>Timber can be preserved by soaking it for over 4 - 6 weeks in arsenical salts (eg copper chrome arsenic) or an arsenic oxide which are then fixed in the wood in a relatively insoluble form. A green powder (copper chrome arsenic) may be left in the posts and battens that may contain up to 5% of arsenic. The arsenic oxide imparts a brown colour to treated wood. Animals are exposed to a very real risk if they lick freshly tanalised wood. A weathering period of at least four weeks is considered necessary to reduce the risk to grazing animals.</p>
<p>Even seasoned timber may be dangerous and cases of poisoning are reported of possums housed in boxes made from tanalised timber. Dogs housed in kennels made from tanalised wood may develop contact dermatitis and arsenic poisoning. Horses have also been poisoned from crib biting tanalised rails and the loss of deer in recently constructed compounds has also been recorded in NZ.</p>
<p>The ash from tanalised timber after it is burnt may contain concentrations of arsenic up to 3%. Deaths from the ingestion of this have occurred in cattle.</p>
<p>Arsenical dips were once a very common cause of poisoning of both sheep and cattle, but arsenical poisoning from this source is now rare due to the ban on their use. Arsenical sheep and cattle dips were usually combined with sulphur and contained 20% soluble arsenic and 3% insoluble arsenious sulphide. When diluted for use the soluble arsenic concentration was between 0.25% and 0.5%. Poisoning (of cattle in particular) usually resulted from stock gaining access to rusted containers of dip which frequently contained lethal residues of arsenic. Deaths from this source were reported as late as 1999.</p>
<p>Sodium and potassium arsenite (Na3AsO3 and K3AsO3) and the thioarsinites have been used as weedkillers and grain dressings. They are now banned in NZ.</p>
<p>Lead and calcium arsenates have been used as fruit tree sprays and sodium arsenate was an ingredient of some flypapers and used as an anthelmintic and for the treatment of footrot in sheep. Arsenicals were also used as medicinal ruminatinic preparations and tonics. Sodium thioarsetarsamide was used in injectable form for treating canine dirofilariasis.</p>
<p>An historical and common form of arsenic was copper arsenite (Paris green) used as a cheap pigment for wallpapers and artificial flowers. Under the damp conditions of many Victorian homes arsine gas was released from the latter which was highly toxic to the inhabitants of houses papered with such material. Arsine gas may also be released from sewage contaminated with arsenical compounds.</p>
<p>Arsenic has also been used in paint pigments, detergents and building materials.</p>
<p>The aromatic or organic arsenicals were developed during the search for less toxic arsenical compounds. Examples of such preparations used in New Zealand and other countries included Acetarsol (Acetylarsen), neoarsphenamine (Salvarsan) sulpharsphenamine (salpharsen). These were used for the treatment of histomoniasis in turkeys and as general tonics. Arecoline acetarsol (Cestarsol) was used as an anthelmintic and purgative for treating tapeworm infestations in dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Arsanilic acid is used as a growth promoting factor in pig and poultry feeds. Three (3) nitro, 4 hydroxyphenyl arsonic acid is used for the treatment of coccidiosis in poultry. They can prove toxic at levels above those recommended. Arsanilic acid has also been used in the control of swine dysentery.</p>
<p>The feed additive 3
  nitro, 4 hydroxyphenylarsonic acid produces toxicity in swine at 250 ppm of the diet if fed for 7
  10 days.</p>

<h3>Toxicity</h3>
<p>The absorption of arsenic compounds occurs through the alimentary tract, respiratory tract and the skin. The absorption of arsenic is continuous and unlimited. The local effect of the arsenic on tissues is usually less important than the generalised capillary and mucosal effects which occur regardless of the route.
<p>The degree of the systemic signs seen following percutaneous absorption depends upon the blood circulation within the epidermis. If there is a good local circulation then rapid absorption occurs with very little local necrosis but with the development of generalised systemic signs will take place. However, if there is exposure to a large quantity of toxic arsenate, then local oedema, necrosis and sloughing of the skin occurs. Regardless of the route of absorption, the major pathological signs are found in the gastrointestinal tract.
<p>Arsenic is transported to all the body tissues, but it is the tissues with the highest concentration of oxidative enzymes, which are most susceptible to its toxic effects. These tissues include the liver, kidney, alimentary tract wall and the spleen. Arsenical compounds readily cross the placental barrier, but they don't penetrate the blood brain barrier very well. Arsenic disappears rapidly from soft tissue, but is stored permanently in keratinised tissues e.g. hair, hoof and skin and in bone. Once arsenic is deposited in keratin it moves slowly along the hair shaft or hoof as the tissue grows.
<p>Factors which affect the toxicity of arsenical compounds include:
<ol>
  <li>The chemical structure of the arsenical compound is very important in determining toxicity. The trivalent forms of arsenic are up to ten times more toxic than the pentavalent forms. <br />
    Soluble arsenical compounds are far more toxic than insoluble compounds. If the compound is insoluble, then the toxicity is determined by the particle size. Finely divided powders are more toxic than coarse compounds. Sodium arsenate is readily soluble and easily absorbed and so, it is more toxic than arsenic trioxide, sodium arsenate and calcium arsenate. In general, aromatic organic arsenical compounds are less toxic than the inorganic aliphatic forms of arsenic.</li>
  <li>Oral administration may reduce the toxicity of some compounds. The condition of the digestive organs, the nature of the ingesta and the method of application, all affect the dose of an arsenical compound that will produce toxic signs. Absorption of dips is particularly rapid through fresh skin wounds. Adult sheep can absorb up to 88mg arsenic trioxide following dipping in a normal dip solution containing 0.2% arsenic.</li>
  <li>The oral lethal dose of sodium arsenite in most species is 1 25 mg/kg. However, there is some species variation and it is thought that cats are the most susceptible followed by horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, swine and birds. See Table 10.<br />
    Herbivores, especially cattle, are more commonly intoxicated with arsenical compounds, because of exposure to contaminated forage and farm chemicals. Cats ingest the syrupy baits intended for insects, and dogs may be poisoned either maliciously or following therapy with heartworm remedies containing arsenic.</li>
  <li>The condition of the individual animal is very important, as toxicity is greatly enhanced in animals which are dehydrated, debilitated, or have a degree of compromised renal or hepatic function. Some dogs infected with heartworm are particularly susceptible to intoxication with thiacetarsamide sodium. Infections in dogs of over 2 4 billion microfilaria cause depression of the major enzyme systems. These metabolic systems are then highly susceptible to inactivation by therapeutic doses of arsenic.<br />
    Chronic poisoning in animals is rare, because arsenic is rapidly excreted from the body. Some authors consider that the flesh of the surviving animals is safe to eat, although the liver and viscera may remain toxic.<br />
    Quantities of arsenic which are considered to be toxic to man, have been found in the milk of cows feeding on grass sprayed with an arsenical weed killer. A withholding period of forty days before slaughter has been recommended after cattle have had access to any form of inorganic arsenic.</li>

  <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
  <p>At a cellular level the trivalent arsenite forms strong covalent bonds with pairs of adjacent sulphydryl groups, in particular the two sulphydryl groups of lipoic acid. This yields a stable compound which inactivates the enzyme systems that rely on the availability of sulphur atoms. Disruption of these enzyme systems interferes with cellular respiration and the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates.</p>
  <p>Small blood vessels, capillaries and arterioles, are particularly affected by the toxic action of arsenic, and early on in the disease these vessels lose the ability to contract. Initially, this is reversible and contraction can be stimulated by the administration of adrenaline, indicating that the dilatation is peripherally conditioned. As the toxicosis progresses, the capillaries become dilated causing hypotensive shock and a rose red discolouration occurs in the skin of man and pigs.</p>
  <p>There is always a lag phase between exposure of the animal to the poison and the appearance of clinical signs. The clinical signs and pathological lesions are a result of the marked changes which occur within the cells, rather than any directly irritant effects of the toxin. This is supported by finding similar pathological changes in the alimentary tracts of animals poisoned either by parenteral administration or by the ingestion of an arsenical compound.</p>
  <p>Within the body, the liver partially methylates arsenates and arsenites, but it is the kidney which is the main excretory organ of arsenical compounds. Less important routes of excretion include the faeces, bile, milk, saliva and sweat. Arsenic may be detected in the urine as early as 5 - 6 hours after exposure to the poison and may persist for 7 - 14 days after a single dose and for up to 10 weeks following repeated administration of arsenical compounds.</p>
  <p>The pathogenesis of inorganic arsenate poisoning is not as completely understood as poisoning with the arsenites. Arsenate can compete with inorganic phosphate in phosphorylation reactions to form unstable arsenyl esters. Arsenate compounds also uncouple oxidative phosphorylations, presumably by competing with inorganic phosphate at one of the energy conserving steps. It has also been postulated that arsenate is reduced to arsenite before exerting its toxic effect. </p>
