<p class="bodytext"><strong>Acepromazine</strong> is very unlikely to provide adequate sedation
  in an excited cat.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Detomidine</strong> would work but only comes in a concentration suitable
  for horses so accurate dosing is difficult. Use medetomidine instead.</p>
<p class="badchoice">Diazepam would not sedate this cat: it might 
  make the cat even more excited.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Halothane</strong> could be used to anaesthetise the cat, but is likely
  to provoke potentially fatal arrhythmias in a very excited cat. This technique
  would only be used as a last resort.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="goodchoice"><strong>Ketamine</strong> is probably 
  the best choice</span>.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Ketamine</strong> and <strong>diazepam</strong> is overkill. The only reason for adding
  the diazepam is to produce muscle relaxation, which is not necessary in this
  case.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Medetomidine</strong> would probably work but can cause severe cardiovascular
  depression.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Saffan</strong> sedation requires high volumes when given im, so it
  is not really suitable.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Zoletil</strong> would work, but is expensive.</p>
