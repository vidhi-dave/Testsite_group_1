		<h4>A study to find out if morphine, dexmedetomidine and maropitant provide pain relief in dogs after ovariohysterectomy (spay)</h4> 
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p><br>
<p>We seek your help and cooperation in conducting a study aimed at improving pain relief after surgery in dogs. We would like to measure pain and blood concentrations of morphine, dexmedetomidine and maropitant combination in dogs being spayed. Both morphine and dexmedetomidine are routinely used to provide pain relief for surgery in dogs. Maropitant is used as an antemetic in dogs and  it has also been shown to possess analgesic effects.</p><br>
<p>Your dog will receive these drugs, either singly or in combination, as part of routine anaesthesia protocol in the clinic.  We will then collect blood samples (2 mL each) at timed intervals (total four times) during anaesthesia and recovery. This procedure involves a routine blood sampling technique and will not pose any significant risks to your dog. Dogs&rsquo; pain will be measured at timed intervals in the postoperative period. If any dog seems to be in pain after surgery, It will be given potent pain killers immediately.</p><br>
<p>This study has been reviewed and approved by the Massey University Animal Ethics Committee (protocol number 17/33).</p><br>
<p>By signing this form, you agree for your dog to participate in the study. If you have any further questions, please contact Kavitha Kongara (contact details below).</p><br>
<p>Your cooperation and willingness to participate in this study are highly appreciated.</p><br><br>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
