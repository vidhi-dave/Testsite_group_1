	<h1>Pain and Analgesia</h1>
	<p>Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. In other words, it hurts and <strong>must</strong> be treated. <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSpainAss.html">Assessment</a> can be tricky.</p>
		<h2>Analgesic Drugs</h2>
	<p>Many drugs have analgesic effects but few are clinically useful. No drug works 
    in every case. The commonly used groups of drugs are: <a href="CNSop-index.html">opioids</a>, <a href="NSAIDindex.html"> NSAIDs</a>, <a href="CNSlocal.html">local anaesthetics</a> and <a href="CNSseda2.html"> &#945;<sub>2</sub> agonists</a>, which are sometimes given in combination to produce <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSbalAnalg.html">balanced analgesia</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There are <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSbalAnalg.html">many other drugs</a> used in people which are less useful in animals (but may be used as adjuvants to one or more of the above drugs): psychotropics (mainly used for neurogenic pain in man - tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), anticonvulsants) and various
odds and sods - capsaicin etc.</p>
  <p>Successful management of pain requires more than just analgesic drugs. Other things to be considered include: emotional aspects - nursing, food, warmth, treat the condition!, physiotherapy and TENS / acupuncture.</p>
  <p>If pain cannot be successfully treated, euthanasia must be considered. If an animal's owner refuses analgesia on the grounds of expense, this is the only option.</p>
	<h4><a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSopDr.html">Opioids</a></h4>
	<p>These are the main strong analgesics used for severe pain. <a href="morphine.html">Morphine</a> is the oldest drug and probably still the best. It is certainly the cheapest. An im dose will last about 4 hours in  the dog and horse, and up to 24 hours in the cat, but the duration of action will depend on the pain. Morphine produces less obvious analgesia in ruminants, but works in pigs (short acting - about 1 hour after normal doses). It is not registered for use in animals. <a href="StudyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSopDr.html">Fentanyl</a> and similar drugs are very potent, short acting drugs mainly used in anaesthesia to cover painful bits of ops or as infusions. Fentanyl lasts about 20mins after an iv dose. Fentanyl <a href="../PKsFiles/PKsPatch.html">patches</a> are sometimes used for longer term analgesia but take up to 24hrs to work.</p>
  <h4><a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/NSAIDindex.html">NSAIDs</a></h4>
  	<p>NSAIDs are a very large group of drugs of diverse chemical structure with the <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/NSAIDeff.html">common property of inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase</a>, and thus reducing prostaglandin production. Prostaglandins perform many functions in the body, including mediating inflammation and sensitising peripheral nerve endings. Use is often limited by side effects - gastric ulceration (common but not usually serious) and renal failure (rare but often fatal). There are lots of <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/NSAIDdrugs.html">drugs</a> registered for use in animals.</p>
  	<h4><a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSlocal.html">Local Anaesthetics</a></h4>
  	<p>These are applied somewhere near a nerve to block conduction. <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSlocTxt.html#drugs">Lignocaine</a> is the most widely used drug, but there are lots of others. These are very usedful in ruminants to produce operative analgesia.</p>
  	<h4><a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSseda2.html"> &#945;<sub>2</sub> Agonists</a></h4>
  	<p>Adrenergic &#945;2 agonists are widely used, especially in large animals, for sedation with analgesia. Although <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSseda2.html#drugs">xylazine</a> is most commonly used, there are lots of <a href="studyGuideSite/CNSfiles/CNSseda2.html#drugs">drugs</a> available.They are also effective analgesics and possibly the most effective class of analgesic drugs in ruminants. &#945;2 antagonists are available and are usually used to reverse sedation but will also reverse analgesia. This is rarely desirable.</p>
