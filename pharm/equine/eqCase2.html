  <p class="titlePharm">Case Scenarios</p>
  <h2 id="c2">Case 2: convulsing foal</h2>
  <p>You have been called to examine an 8-hour-old thoroughbred filly that appeared normal at birth. However, the foal has become progressively dull and depressed over the last few hours. When you arrive the foal is in lateral recumbency and is seizuring. Given the urgency of the situation you choose to control the seizures before performing a physical examination.</p>
  <p>What are your treatment options for controlling seizures in foals? Considering the potential causes of seizures in foals, what other drugs may be needed in this case? Please outline the risks and benefits of the drugs you have chosen.</p>
	<h2>Answer</h2>
	<p>You need to sedate the filly immediately. Drug options include:</p>
<p><b>Diazepam</b> – anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant therefore good for controlling seizures and provides a good level of sedation. Adverse effects in horses include muscle fasciculations, weakness and ataxia.  It is given intravenously at a dose rate of 0.05-0.4mg/kg and has a duration of action of 20 minutes. The dose may be repeated in 30 minutes if the seizures are not yet under control.  </p>
<p><b>Phenobarbital</b> – barbiturate used primarily as an anti-seizure medication (2-4 mg/kg). Provides long lasting control but is takes 20 minutes to work to effect. There is also a risk of respiratory depression especially if given too rapidly I/V, therefore an E-T tube should be ready just in case. The metabolism of phenobarbitone is slow in neonates so care needs to be taken not to over-dose the patient.</p>
<p>Other barbiturate options are propofol and pentobarbitone.  Similar effects as phenobarbitone.  Another point to note is that it’s unlikely that a sterile bottle of these drugs will be ‘in the truck’ and in an already compromised foal this would be far from ideal.  Also propofol has been associated with introduction of infection due to the vehicle it’s in and likewise would be contraindicated in this foal.</p>
<p>Once the seizures are under control the foal could be stomach tubed and given potassium bromide which has a calming effect.</p>
<p>Supportive therapy for any case is vital as recurrence is common.   This is especially the case in this depressed foal who is unlikely to of had a drink from its mother.  Once the seizures are under control a stomach tube should be placed and a glucose solution given via this route and IV dextrose given for immediate effect.  Once the foal can suckle the IV dextrose can be stopped and the foal should be encouraged to suckle from the dam. Colostrum is of upmost importance in recovery and this may also need to be stomach tubed also.  Another option is to give IV plasma transfusion to raise IgG levels (1-2L).</p>
<p>Potential underlying causes of the seizures could be:</p>
<p>Dummy foal – this is a syndrome that has no known aetiology and results in seizures and death. Treatment is supportive only (above).</p>
<p>Hypoxia – give oxygen if required.</p>
<p>Hypoglycaemia - IV fluids containing dextrose.   Beware cerebral oedema from fluid overdose.</p>
<p>Sepsis or bacterial meningitis – give high dose antibiotics = Penicillin (22,000 IU/kg, IV) in combination with amikacin sulfate (20-25 mg/kg, IV)  or metronidazole (10-15 mg/kg) indicated if an anaerobic infection is suspected.</p>
<p>Colic in foals can manifest in different/strange ways than in adults.  In a foal this young it could be due to meconium impaction which results in intestinal endotoxin release which could be contributing to the seizures (in combination with hypoglycaemia, etc).  Treat with fluids and antiendotoxins e.g. flunixin (0.3mg/kg) or even better is buscopan which contains hyoscine which is an anti-spasmodic.</p>

<h2>My Answer</h2>
<h3>Drugs</h3>
<p>The foal should be given a benzodiazepine iv (usually diazepam, but midazolam would be better). The mare will probably need to be sedated as well (alpha 2 agonist). Diazepam will last for about 20mins, so longer term control will be needed, if you decide to treat the foal. As specific as possible a diagnosis should be made, and the prognosis should be discussed with the owner. The foal will probably need phenobarbitone iv injections. Phenobarbitone will reach its peak effect after about 20mins, and should last 2 hours though this can be considerably extended in neonatal foals.</p>
<p>The cause of the problem may have been hypoxia during birth, but at this stage, oxygen is unlikely to be needed.</p>
<h3>Side effects</h3>
<p>Benzodiazepines have essentially no side effects but diazepam is not water soluble and is dissolved in propylene glycol in the bottle. This can cause massive haemolysis, which can lead to kidney problems with the haemoglobin. Propylene glycol can also cause phlebitis. It is painful if injected im.</p>
<p>Phenobarbitone, like other barbiturates, is a potent respiratory depressant. In severe cases, the dose required to control seizures will also cause significant respiratory depression. You should have an endotracheal tube and means of ventilating handy. Weaning the foal off phenobarb involves waiting to see what happens when the drug wears off: if the foal convulses, it should be given more drug. The longer the convulsions last, the worse the prognosis.</p></div>
