  <p class="titlePharm">Case Scenarios</p>
  <h2 id="c4">Case 4: wound</h2>
  <p>You are a locum vet working a weekend. The practice car is fully stocked for you. You attend a horse with a wound 5 cm long and of 2 hours duration, caused by contact with a sharp piece of corrugated iron. It is on the lateral aspect of the chest and on careful inspection and palpation you determine it involves only skin, subcutis and superficial muscle. Wound edges are sharp, gaping by 8mm, there are no debris in the wound. You flush, debride the edges and suture it in two layers under sedation and local analgesia.</p>
  <p>What drugs you would use in the whole procedure you have undertaken? Justify the reason for use of each particular class of drug you use, and which particular drug in each class.</p>
  <p>Concerning antibiotics, in the car there is procaine penicillin and long acting pen-strep. Which would you use and why? State exactly the regimen (this means exact name of drug, amount, volume, route, site, frequency and duration of therapy).</p>
  <p>The wound heals absolutely perfectly, and you remove the sutures 10 days later. What contribution to wound healing do you think the antibiotic regimen had?</p>
	<h2>Answer</h2>
	<p>After careful examination of the wound and the rest of the animal to ensure the animal is fine to cope with sedation, we would sedate the horse.</p>
	
	<p>The choices of sedative classes include alpha 2 agonists, phenothiazines or a benzodiazepine. Morpine can also be used, but when used alone this can cause restlessness, so it should be combined with another agent such as xylazine.</p>
	
	<p>The most commonly available pheonthiazine, acepromazine only results in very mild sedation in horses, which would not be adequate for a stitch up when it is important that the horse is reasonably well sedated to make the procedure easy and safe, especially if the restraint options at this property are limited. ACP can also result in permanent penile prolapse in stallions. Unfortunately, in our inadequate history, we didn’t record this horse’s sex. ACP also takes a long for sedation to take occur (~20minutes). </p>
	
	<p>Benzodiazepines also result in only mild sedation in adult horses, lasting around 20 minutes. </p>
	
	<p>We would choose an alpha 2 agonist. </p>
	<p>These will provide dose related sedation, good analgesia and, less importantly, decreased sympathetic outflow. These agents produce reliable sedation in horses. But it must be remembered that horses can still suddenly kick with any sedative agent. A reversal agent is available. Note, these agents cause profound cardiovascular depression, so the cardiovascular status of the horse should be checked before administration, and periodically during sedation. </p>
	<p>Of the alpha 2 agonists, we would choose xylazine.</p>
	<p>This drug is cheap and easily available and would provide adequate sedation for around half an hour and analgesia for around 15 minutes, which is plenty of time to administer local. This amount of time should also be adequate for experienced clinicians like us to stitch up this would. Using a dose rate of 1mg/kg should provide adequate sedation (a 500kg horse would require 500mg, given IV). Allow the horse to rest for 5 minutes until peak effect. </p>
	<p>Other possible agents include detomidine, which has a slightly longer action or sedation, causes more ataxia, and is more expensive. Romifidine is another option. This is the longest lasting of the three, and causes the least ataxia. However, it is also expensive, and not justified in this case. </p>
	<p><br />
	We would then proceed to administer local to the wound site. We would inject the local around the wound site in a ring block. We would use lignocaine, which has a quick onset and a duration of an hour or two which would provide the necessary time for the operation. It is cheap and in the vet car. The ring block is done by injecting blebs around the wound site to form a complete circle around it. No more than 200ml of a 2% solution should be used, to avoid toxicity (this is much, much more than would be required anaesthetise the area. </p>
	
	<p>The wound would be flushed with sterile saline with a syringe and an 18G needle to achieve a good pressure, and then the edges debrided with a scalpel and stitched up. Solutions containing chlorhexidine or povodine iodine could be used for irrigation, but are probably not required in this case. </p>
	
	<p>Longer term pain relief would be provided. The options are an opioid or a NSAID. An NSAID would be the drug of choice as the pain is likely to be moderate, and the NSAID will also help decrease inflammation.</p>
	<p>The best choice would be phenytbutazone. This is cheap and great for musculoskeletal pain in the horse. It offers mild pain relief at the normal does. The first dose can be given IV, and a remaining three days dose given to the owner to place in the food. </p>
	<p> <br />
	The tetanus vaccination status of the animal needs to be discussed with the owner. If the horse is current with its vaccinations, then the toxoid can be given as a precaution to provide an anamnestic response. If the horse in unvaccinated, then give 7,500 units of tetanus antitoxin as prophylaxis, this can be given subcutaneously or intramuscularly. This horse should also be vaccinated. </p>
	
	<p>Antibiotics are not required in this case since it is a superficial wound that was lavaged and debrided and closed by primary closure within the golden period of healing. So contamination is likely to be minimal. This wound should have granulated within 3 days, and after this time should be minimally susceptible to infection. </p>
	<p>However this scenario says that we gave an antibiotic So we will choose procaine penicillin.</p>
	
	<p>Propercillin:</p>
	<p>Only a single dose should be given (because even that is not necessary!), </p>
	<p>This has a 63 day meat with holding period so the owner should be warned not to eat this horse, or any foals that it produces within the next 63 days. </p>
	<p>The concentration is 300mg/mL.</p>
	<p>12-18mg/kg is the required dose.</p>
	<p>Eg 500kg horse, 500kg x 12mg/kg / 300mg/mL</p>
	<p>= 20 mL. This should be given IM, ensure it is not IV. </p>
	<p>Give in the middle third of the neck into the muscle. </p>
	
	<p>The pen/strep combination is not indicated since most of the contamination is likely to be gram positive skin commensals which should be easily taken care of by the penicillin. Use of streptomycin is not indicated in this case because gram negative aerobic bacteria are not a major concern and because the its use should be avoided where possible (resistance, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicty, and a very long WHP).</p>	<h2>leave a comment</h2>

<h2>My Answer</h2>
<h3>Sedation</h3>
<p>An &#945;<sub>2</sub> agonist, proabably detomidine, would be useful to provide sedation and some analgesia for examination and surgery.</p>
<h3>Local anaesthetic block</h3>
<p>To provide surgical analgesia. Mepivacaine is better than lignocaine, as it provokes less irritation in horses.</p>
<h3>Wound flush</h3>
<p>Sterile saline rather than antiseptic will remove any loose bits without damaging tissue.</p>
<h3>Antibiotic</h3>
<p>Unnecessary but usually given. Sodium or potassium benzylpenicillin 20 - 100mg/kg iv asap is best, high dose procaine penicillin im next and procaine penicillin plus streptomycin or benzathine penicillin worst.</p>
<p>If the wound is clean, the antibiotic will have no effect on healing, but the procaine or streptomycin can cause side effects.</p>
