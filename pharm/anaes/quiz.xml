<?xml version="1.0"?><QUIZ TITLE="Sheep Anaesthesia Pre-practical Test">  <QUESTION TEXT="1. What fasting instructions would you give the owner of a small ruminant like these sheep? "  	ANSWER="4"   	DefaultFeedback="The volume of rumen contents should be minimised to reduce bloat and regurgitation but dehydration is not desirable. 24h off food and 12h off water is the usual compromise.">  	<CHOICE>concentrates only for 24h before anaesthesia</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>water only for 48h</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>dry hay only for 24h</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>no food for 24h, no water for 12h</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>no water for 2h</CHOICE>  </QUESTION>    <QUESTION TEXT="2.

How should alphaxalone be given for induction?"  	ANSWER="5"   	DefaultFeedback="If the alphaxalone is given relatively slowly, less is needed for induction. Half the calculated dose over 30 secs is the usual compromise.">  	<CHOICE>the whole dose as fast as possible</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>half the dose as fast as possible then the rest over 30 secs</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>half the dose as fast as possible, wait 15 secs, assess, then half the rest as fast as possible</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>half the dose over one minute, then reassess</CHOICE>    <CHOICE>half the dose over 30 secs, assess after 15 secs, then half the rest if necessary</CHOICE>  </QUESTION>    <QUESTION TEXT="11.
