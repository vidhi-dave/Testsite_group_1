  <h2>Other names</h2>
  <p>English ivy</p>
  <h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
  <p>Ivy is a woody climbing or creeping vine with aerial roots. It has glossy evergreen leaves that have a leathery texture with the underside of the leaf being paler. Other possible variations in colour include yellow green edging of the leaf to yellow green all over. The young leaf is 3 or 5 lobed with the central lobe being the longest and the adult leaves are entire and can range in diameter from 4 to l0cm. Flowers yellowish green in globular clusters; smooth black globular berries approximately 8mm in diameter in winter.</p>
  <h2 id="simPl"> Similar plants </h2>
  <p>Other <a href="../../ivies.html">ivies</a>. Boston ivy (sometimes confused with Virginia creeper) has similar shaped leaves but is deciduous. Probably not toxic. <a href="../german_ivy/germ_ivy.html">German ivy</a> and <a href="../cape-ivy/cape_ivy.html">Cape ivy</a> (toxic) have similar shaped leaves but are related to ragwort. They do not have aerial roots or suckers.</p>
  <h2 id="dist"> Distribution </h2>
  <p>Native to UK but found throughout the world. Many garden forms (derived from subspecies) are widely planted, especially as ground cover on steep banks. In NZ both the wild and cultured plants are widely distributed. They can be found climbing up trees and walls and are very tolerant of shade which contributes to their ability to grow in most habitats.</p>
  <h2 id="tox"> Toxin </h2>
  <p>Hederasaponins A and B which are partially hydrolysed to toxic substances m and b hederins by the removal of sugars. All parts of the plant are toxic to individuals sensitive to the plant, with the berries and leaves being especially toxic. There has been a case of poisoning in poultry after eating the seeds. Only toxic when eaten in large amounts. Decoctions have been used as an insecticide.</p>
  <h2 id="spec"> Species affected </h2>
  <p>Overseas, poisonings have been reported in sheep, cattle, deer, dogs and children. No reports from NZ yet.</p>
  <h2 id="clinSiAc"> Clinical signs acute </h2>
  <p>In small quantities ivy can have a purgative effect and cause diarrhoea, while in large quantities it can lead to excitement, ataxia, staggering, muscle spasms or conversely coma. It also causes breathing difficulties.</p>
  <h2 id="clinSiCh"> Clinical signs chronic </h2>
  <h2 id="pm"> Post mortem signs </h2>
  <p>Gastroenteritis</p>
  <h2 id="diag"> Diagnosis </h2>
  <p>History of exposure to the plant and clinical signs.</p>
  <h2 id="diff"> Differential diagnosis </h2>
  <p>Could be confused with milk fever which is relatively common and would be more likely to be suspected with these signs.</p>
  <h2 id="treat"> Treatment </h2>
  <p>For animals that have ingested large quantities of ivy emesis should be induced or gastric lavage performed.</p>
  <h2 id="prog"> Prognosis </h2>
  <p>Unless ingested in very large amounts prognosis is usually good.</p>
  <h2 id="prev"> Prevention </h2>
