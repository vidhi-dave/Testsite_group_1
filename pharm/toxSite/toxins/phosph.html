		<h1>Phosphorus</h1>
					<p>Phosphorus poisoning is still reported in NZ although less frequently than in the 1950-1970 period when phosphorised baits were used extensively for rabbit and possum control and as rat bait.</p>
					<p>Phosphorus poisoning has been diagnosed in all species of domestic animals. In New Zealand losses in cattle and sheep have resulted from animals eating baits intended for rabbit and possum control. Dogs, cats and poultry were mainly poisoned from these sources. The number of confirmed cases in NZ has now decreased.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Phosphorus exists in two forms, red phosphorus is inert and nontoxic while white and yellow phosphorus are oil soluble, unstable in air and highly toxic. The finely divided form of yellow phosphorus is currently used as toxic bait. When exposed to moisture, it glows in the dark.</p>
					<h3>Rabbit baits and possum baits</h3>
					<p>Phosphorus was incorporated into two types of baits, phosphorised pollard pellets and phosphorised jam. Phosphorised jam is used quite extensively for rabbits and possum control. Such baits can be very toxic and need to be allowed to weather for at least three weeks before it is safe to allow sheep and cattle to return to areas where poison had been laid. Secondary phosphorus poisoning of dogs has also been reported when possums poisoned by phosphorus have been ingested.</p>
					<p>Most cases of poisoning with these baits have occurred on sheep and cattle stations through the accidental dropping of bait into areas where stock were being held during the poison laying, or where stock were moved on to poisoned pastures too soon after the laying of bait. For a brief period, the high toxicity of 1080 (sodium monofluoracetate) for dogs led many killer boards to return to phosphorus as a safer alternative. Phosphorus baits present a fire hazard however in dry weather as they will ignite spontaneously.</p>
					<h3>Rat baits</h3>
					<p>Several phosphorised rat baits were sold in New Zealand. The use of these led to the poisoning of dogs, cats and poultry. The phosphorus in rat baits was finely divided white phosphorus mixed with grease. The grease protected the phosphorus from oxidation and also facilitated its absorption in ingestion. Such baits were particularly toxic.</p>
					<h3>Phosphorised wheat</h3>
					<p>This was once used to kill sparrows and not infrequently led to the accidental loss of poultry.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>Yellow phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison that causes extensive injury to organs and tissues. Extensive fatty degeneration of liver, kidneys and brain occurs. Cardiovascular collapse may occur due to hypocalcaemia or a direct cardiotoxic injury. The poison is a strong irritant on the stomach mucosa.</p>
					<p>The toxic dose varies considerably according to the state in which the phosphorus is ingested:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Horse and cattle</td>
							<td>0.5-2.0g</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Pig</td>
							<td>0.5-3.0g</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Dog</td>
							<td>0.05-0.18g</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Fowl</td>
							<td>0.02g</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
										<p>Phosphorus is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, by inhalation and through damaged epithelium. It is oxidised in the blood to phosphate. Phosphorus is eliminated in the urine and expired air. Exhaled phosphorus smells like garlic and glows in the dark.</p>
					<p>Depending on the dose and nature and amount of stomach contents, phosphorus may be very irritant to the gastric mucosa, particularly in monogastric animals. Some phosphorus will be found in the liver a few hours after ingestion. By a mechanism which is not understood it causes damage particularly to the periportal hepatocytes. The result being that after 2
4 days if the animal survives signs of acute liver injury are apparent. This is particularly so in ruminants. The latter changes are seen mainly in animals that have ingested doses insufficient to cause immediate death.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>As indicated above, the course of the poisoning may be brief or last for several days. Phosphorus is an irritant poison and the clinical signs, depending on the dose, may appear very quickly.</p>
					<p>In ruminants the first signs are depression, anorexia and severe thirst. Animals tend to look for water.</p>
					<p>There is intense abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting (in dogs and cats and even horses and pigs). The vomit may be luminous in the dark and have a garlic odour. (Like the smell of wet matches).</p>
					<p>If the animal survives this period, and frequently they do not, then there may be a period of apparent recovery lasting for a few hours to a few days after which the abdominal pain and vomiting recur and jaundice, liver failure and nervous signs develop. The animal finally dies in a coma.</p>
					<p>In ruminants the delayed form of phosphorus poisoning is characterised by severe hepatic dysfunction with photosensitization. The latter signs are seen in open
faced sheep and white coloured cattle. The particular signs include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>marked swelling of face and ears;</li>
						<li>closure of eyelids;</li>
						<li>partial blindness;</li>
						<li>bottle jaw.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>The following are common features of phosphorus poisoning.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>severe gastroenteritis;</li>
						<li>enlarged fatty liver;</li>
						<li>jaundice as seen in all body fat;</li>
						<li>congested kidneys with multiple petechial haemorrhages;</li>
						<li>extravasation of blood into subcutaneous tissue and between muscle layers;</li>
						<li>there may be a smell of phosphorus (garlic odour) when the abdomen is opened. In case of birds visible fumes may be present when the gizzard is opened.</li>
						<li>The gut lining strips off easily.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It should be noted that in ruminants while the above general picture may be found, it will vary according to the amount of phosphorus ingested.</p>
					<p>Experimentally it has been shown that there is no obvious fatty liver in animals which received 25 lethal doses of phosphorus, but death occurred in 18 hours. Reducing the amount given through 4, 2 and 1 lethal doses, the time of death was regularly prolonged to 27, 40 and 72 hours respectively and as the survival time increased the liver becomes progressively more fatty.</p>
					<p>Similarly the changes in the alimentary tract may alter with decreasing dose rates. While there may be little change in the lower alimentary tract at high dose levels there may be a progressive change to severe haemorrhage in the colon and rectum resulting from one lethal dose. In the latter case the colon and rectum frequently contain large quantities of pure blood.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>The laboratory confirmation of phosphorus poisoning may not be very satisfactory even when the history, clinical signs and autopsy all suggest such a diagnosis. The aim of the laboratory tests is to detect free phosphorus or its oxidation products in the viscera of the dead animal.</p>
					<p>Samples for analysis are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stomach contents dog, cat and pig.</li>
						<li>Rumen contents, sheep, cattle, goat and deer.</li>
						<li>Whole bird or crop and gizzard; poultry.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Liver and kidney in fixed sections for histopathology are useful. Fresh liver samples may also be forwarded for phosphorus detection.</p>
					<p>In cats the whole carcass should be sent as cases have been reported where phosphorus was not detectable in stomach contents but was present in faeces.</p>
					<p>In ruminants send samples from the animals which have died suddenly or early in an outbreak of phosphorus poisoning. These are most likely to have ingested higher doses of phosphorus.</p>
					<p>Stomach samples should be frozen to preserve elemental phosphorus or contact your diagnostic laboratory for handling requirements.</p>
					<h2 id="diff">Differential Diagnoses</h2>
					<p>The signs are comparable to those seen in facial eczema.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>If the dose of phosphorus is not too large and liver injury is not extensive a few animals may recover with symptomatic treatment. In ruminants the prognosis is extremely grave and recovery is unlikely.</p>
					<p>Dogs and cats may be treated if an emetic is given immediately to induce vomiting. Copper sulphate as a 1% solution is ideal as it is said to render phosphorus inert by forming an insoluble copper phosphide.</p>
					<p class="caption">Dose of copper sulphate 1% solution.</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Dog</td>
							<td>10-60ml</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Cattle</td>
							<td>400-500ml</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Sheep and pigs</td>
							<td>100ml</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Parenteral vitamin K<sub>1</sub> at 2 mg/kg should be given to aid recovery.</p>
					<p>Gastric lavage may be useful. An alternative to copper sulphate is potassium permanganate given as a 0.1-0.2% solution.</p>
					<p>A saline purgative is then recommended to remove further toxic material, but on no account use lipid preparations such as liquid paraffin, vegetable oils or milk.</p>
					<p>Full supportive treatment should also be given.</p>
					<h2 id="prog">Prognosis</h2>
					<p> A few animals may survive for weeks.</p>
