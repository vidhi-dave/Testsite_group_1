		<h1>Selenium</h1>
						<p>Previously, three types of selenium poisoning were recognised clinically, namely acute selenium toxicosis, subacute poisoning or &quot;blind staggers &quot; and chronic poisoning or alkali disease. There is now considerable evidence to suggest that the condition of &quot;blind staggers&quot; reported both in the USA and Australia, although associated with the ingestion of indicator plants with a high selenium content, more closely resembles loco disease or <em>Swainsona</em> poisoning than selenium toxicity.</p>
						<p>However the major losses of stock in New Zealand have been associated with incorrect dosage of selenium products either by overdose or the simultaneous use of two or more products containing selenium. Between 1973 and 1989 over 500 cases (not individual animals) of selenium poisoning in livestock were confirmed by the Animal Health Laboratories in New Zealand. Fifty
two percent of these were in cattle, 28% in sheep, 6% goats, 4% pigs and 4% horses. Deer also have been involved. Surveillance records from 1990 to 1999 present a similar picture in spite of the compulsory warning labels on all selenium containing products used in the animal industry. Although the majority of cases deal with cattle, the numbers of sheep per case are much higher, the losses frequently involving hundreds of animals. One such case in (1993) 480 lambs died out of 656 dosed with selenium. The number of separate cases ranged from 5-71 per year in NZ between 1973 and 1989. (Rammel, 1991)</p>
						<p>All species are susceptible to acute selenium toxicity. However horses and cattle only appear to develop chronic selenosis (alkali disease).</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Selenium products are used prophylactically to prevent selenium deficiency diseases. This includes a range of oral and injectable products and selenium prills (usually in fertiliser).</p>
					<h3>Oral products</h3>
					<p>The main administration of Se is in the form of sodium selenite or sodium selenate either given as a liquid or more commonly administered with the anthelmintic drench.</p>
					<h3>Intra ruminal pellet/bullet</h3>
					<p>(Permasel selenium pellets) The large dose of selenium available in this pellet is released very slowly because of its insoluble nature and large particle size. It is incorporated with iron filings (95%).</p>
					<h3>Injectable forms of selenium</h3>
					<p>The safety factor from injectable forms of selenium is considerably less than from oral forms of administration. It is available as an injectable selenised solution or in combination with vaccine. A slow release injectable selenium product (&quot;Deposel &quot;) is a barium selenate paste which because of its slow release does not present a great risk.</p>
					<h3>Selenium prills</h3>
					<p>Selenium prills contain 1% selenium as sodium selenate. The annual application to the whole farm at the rate of 1 kg prills/ha is effective in supplying adequate selenium for twelve months in most cases. If the programme is continued annually the residual levels of selenium in the soil should rise gradually to an adequate concentration over 20
30 years. In most cases the whole farm is not topdressed; strip topdressing is adequate. In some cases the application of much higher levels of Se has been advocated. This could lead to toxicity problems.</p>
					<h3>Transdermal products</h3>
					<p>Selenium is available as a pour on for cattle and deer. The product is formulated to be absorbed through the skin. Selenium toxicity is a risk if used in conjunction with other selenium supplements. Selenium toxicity can be produced in dogs and cats following the use of selenium preparations for the treatment of non specific dermatoses e.g. selenium disulphide.</p>

						<h3>Soil and Plants (not NZ)</h3>
						<p>NZ soils generally have low selenium levels. In some countries, notably, USA, Ireland, Israel and Australia soil levels of selenium in some areas are high. Selenium is found in soil in both inorganic and organic compounds, only a few of which are available to plants. In areas where selenium poisoning occurs, the selenium content of the soil is usually about 1-6 ppm although much higher levels have been encountered. The danger to livestock from selenium normally results from the accumulation of the element by certain plants. In some soils the levels of selenium are negligible but true accumulator plants are able to extract the minute amount of available selenium and concentrate it many times in their foliage. <em>Morinda reticulata</em>, which causes chronic selenosis in horses in Australia, is one such plant. Selenium accumulator plants have been classified into several categories.</p>
						<p>i. Obligate accumulators or &quot;indicator plants &quot; which need selenium for their development and will grow only in areas where there are high soil levels of selenium. (These plants may contain 1000-15000 ppm Se).</p>
						<p>ii. Facultative accumulators or secondary selenium absorbers which may grow in areas with no selenium but if selenium is present these plants will take it up and accumulate it.</p>
						<p>iii. Most plants are non accumulators, but may absorb high levels and become dangerous. Good examples of the latter are couch (<em>Cynodon dactylon</em>) and buffel (<em>Cenchrus australis</em>). In some areas of Australia cultivation of soil brought up the element from highly seleniferous subsoils and made it readily available to topsoil for the uptake by various pasture grasses and herbages.</p>
						<p>One of the main dangers of the Se accumulator plants is that they can take up selenium which is not available to other plants and convert it into a form which when returned to the soil by their decomposition can be absorbed by forage plants which then become dangerous to stock.</p>
						<p>Seleniferous areas usually have a low rainfall as otherwise the soluble selenium compounds would be leached out of the soil and not taken up by the accumulator plants.</p>
					<p>One of the world's best known accumulator plants is <em>Neptunia amplexicaulis</em>.  The content of selenium in this plant in poison areas frequently reaches 3000 4000 ppm.  The soil in Australia where this plant is particularly found is derived from cretaceous marine limestone shale outcrops which are selenium rich.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<h3>Inorganic selenium</h3>
  <p>Selenium as sodium selenite or sodium selenate is effective in prevention of the selenium responsive diseases of livestock.  The dose rates recommended for the different species are somewhat empirical.</p>

					<p>The interval between such doses is also largely empirical e.g. for sheep it is recommended that ewes be dosed before mating, before lambing and lambs be dosed at 2 weeks, then at weaning and probably twice during the hogget growth stage. A variety of recommendations have been given for other species. The present widespread use of mineral supplements in anthelmintic drenches, particularly in lambs and hoggets that may be dosed as frequently as every 3-4 weeks for up to 4-5 times has been associated with subsequent selenium toxicosis. The half life of selenium after dosing is about one month in the blood and two months in the liver. Therefore, it is not surprising that the repeat dosing of animals with selenium products calls for considerable care to prevent stock losses. About 70% of all reported selenium toxicoses in New Zealand have been associated with the excessive use of selenium drenches.</p>
					<p>Selenium is readily absorbed from the gut and distributed throughout the body. The highest concentrations are found in the liver, spleen and kidney and the lowest in brain and muscle.</p>
					<p>After prolonged administration large amounts are found in the wool, hair and hooves. Selenium can cross the placental barrier and deformed hooves have been seen in newborn animals as a result of excessive selenium ingestion by the dam. Selenium compounds are not well absorbed through the skin so that lotions containing selenium are not normally dangerous unless ingested. The main excretion of selenium is in the urine in monogastric animals and in the faeces of ruminants. Some selenium is excreted via the sweat, exhaled air and milk.</p>
					<p>Selenium toxicity is probably related to the interference with sulphur containing amino acid systems. Gluthione depletion and lipid peroxidation are implicated in the toxicity. Chronic selenosis depresses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation. Ascorbic acid levels fall in the tissues. Varying amounts of selenium can be tolerated by individual animals and the stress of driving and yarding may increase an animal's susceptibility to poisoning. Likewise deficiencies in cobalt and protein in the diet may also increase an animal's susceptibility to selenium toxicosis.</p>
					<p>The route of administration is also important. Injected selenium is likely to incur a greater risk of toxicity than when dosed orally. The absorption from the parenteral route being twice as fast as from the gut and selenium compounds accidentally injected intramuscularly are absorbed very rapidly.</p>
					<h3>Organic selenium</h3>
					<p> Selenium is held in plants mostly in the form of selenoamino acids. In the non accumulator plants the selenoamino acids are protein aminoacids and the selenium is found in the plant mainly in an insoluble form. In the accumulator plants selenium is found in non protein selenoamino acids and for these plants the compound is selenocystathionine. The latter is soluble and readily available to animals.</p>
					<h3>Selenium Dosing Accidents</h3>
					<p>The majority of losses of animals following the administration of selenium are from careless administration of a single dose. The dose given has been either miscalculated or the incorrect preparation has been used. There are records which indicate that some poisoned animals have received selenium from two sources simultaneously. This is particularly applicable to the problem of repeat dosing as described previously.</p>
					<p>Another aspect of potential toxicity is the inadequate mixing of selenium added to anthelmintic drenches. Veterinarians should be extremely careful to ensure that the concentration of selenium in the premix concentrate is not confused. Mixes used in NZ vary from 5 mg Se/ml to 25mg Se/ml.</p>
					<p>Further it should be noted that there is considerable species difference with respect to the minimum lethal dose of selenium. Sheep and horses would appear to be the most susceptible domestic species.</p>

					<p>It should be noted that in many field cases of acute selenium toxicosis, the above levels of selenium have not been given. Lambs are recorded as dying following the administration of 5mg selenium parenterally and 10-15 mg orally.</p>
					<p>Toxicity probably depends more on the route of administration and the rate of dosing rather than the total amount of selenium given over a period. In weaned lambs, liver selenium concentrations as high as 30,000 nmol/kg in the first 24 hours have been measured following the subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mg Se/kg. Oral dosing does not cause such a high liver Se concentration.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<h3>Acute poisoning (ruminants)</h3>
					<p>This may occur as a result of eating large quantities of seleniferous plants or the accidental overdose of animals with various selenium compounds (New Zealand).</p>
					<p>Deaths may occur within 24 hours in most cases but losses may continue for days to even weeks in some cases.</p>
					<p>The following are summarised clinical signs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Dyspnoea.</li>
						<li>Rapid weak pulse.</li>
						<li>Tympany.</li>
						<li>Colic.</li>
						<li>Polyuria.</li>
						<li>Cyanosis and death due to respiratory failure.</li>
						<li>Diarrhoea is profuse and watery.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Acute/Subacute poisoning (pigs)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Appetite loss.</li>
						<li>Anaemia.</li>
						<li>Depressed thrift.</li>
						<li>Hair loss.</li>
						<li>Stiffness and hoof separation.</li>
						<li>Joint erosion.</li>
						<li>Posterior paralysis and blind staggers.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Acute/Subacute poisoning (poultry)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Severe fatty changes (seen at autopsy)</li>
						<li>Reduced weight gains.</li>
						<li>Reduced reproductive performance, lowered hatchability and deformed embryos.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> The signs of acute toxicosis would also include those seen in ruminants.</p>
					<h3>Chronic poisoning (Alkali disease)</h3>
					<p>Caused by the daily ingestion of cereals, grasses and other forage plants containing selenium.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Loss of long hair from mane and tail of horses and the switch in cattle.</li>
						<li>Dull coat, emaciation and depraved appetite.</li>
						<li>Interference of blood circulation to the extremities results in rings appearing on the hoof just below the coronary band. In severe cases cracks may appear. In extreme cases the hoof may slough off and a severe lameness develops.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Blind staggers (Swainsona poisoning) Loco disease?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Loss of weight.</li>
						<li>Rough coat.</li>
						<li>Staggering gait.</li>
						<li>Impaired vision.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As the disease progresses, animals move in circles and walk into obstacles. There is salivation, lacrimation, severe abdominal pain and inability to swallow.</p>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>In acute toxicosis, the following are the main features seen at post mortem:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Degeneration and necrosis of liver, kidney and heart muscle.</li>
						<li>Severe pulmonary oedema and hydrothorax.</li>
						<li>Fluid filled intestines.</li>
						<li>Generalised haemorrhages and congestion of most organs.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>Following absorption the greatest proportional increase in tissue selenium concentration occurs in the liver. Hence liver tissue is usually used for confirmatory analysis of toxicosis.</p>

					<p>Maximum residue limit in livestock liver is 25,000 nmol/kg.</p>

					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Acute Poisoning: An expensive treatment that is worth considering in some cases is the administration of acetylcysteine(Parvolex) at 140 mg/kg IV, a loading dose, followed by 70 mg/kg IV every 6 hours as needed. The treatment must be instituted early but the prognosis is guarded to poor depending on the severity of the overdose.</p>
					<p>Chronic toxicity in horses has been treated with increasing the protein content of the diet. In some species, particularly calves and pigs, a diet with arsanilic acid (50-100 ppm) may be beneficial.</p>
					<h2 id="prev">Prevention</h2>
					<p>Establish first that a selenium deficiency exists or that animals will respond to Se treatment. This involves regular monitoring of animals to ensure that their Se intake is adequate for good health. Also ensure that the correct levels of Se are prescribed and the mixing of concentrates with anthelmintics is done correctly. Following treatment it is helpful to monitor animals periodically for Se levels. This can be done cheaply and easily by use of either the glutathione peroxidase test or the liver Se concentration if available.</p>
					<p>In summary, it is important to remember that the level of selenium producing acute toxicity depends on the form of selenium, method of administration, animal age, feed (eg. Protein availability, cobalt status and stress factors). Selenium given parenterally is more toxic than by mouth, especially if the injections are given intramuscularly rather than subcutaneously as recommended.</p>
					<p>The safest methods of administering selenium are topdressing prills, incorporation in feed premixes and intraruminal dosing. Subcutaneous injections with barium selenate (Deposel) are also relatively safe as selenium is released form the depot very slowly. The safety factor (toxic dose divided by the recommended dose) with prills has been estimated at 20 compared with 5 for oral dosing and 2.5 or less for parenteral dosing.</p>
