		<h1>Zinc</h1>
					<p>There are many well authenticated cases of zinc poisoning in domestic animals. Young animals appear to be more susceptible to the effects of zinc than mature animals. Significant zinc poisoning in animals in New Zealand was probably first recorded in 1936 as a cause of death in young growing pigs. As a toxicosis it has been reported in cattle, sheep, ferrets, mink, horses, dogs, cats, pigs and poultry.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>There are a variety of sources available and dangerous to animals. These have changed with time and probably in New Zealand and Australia the present two greatest risks of zinc toxicosis for domestic animals are zinc sulphateused in footrot control and zinc oxideused in the control of facial eczema and lupinosis.</p>
					<h4>Zinc in the control of footrot</h4>
					<p>Relatively high levels of zinc sulphate 20% are used in the control of ovine footrot. It has been suggested that such baths are even palatable to sheep. Sheep have been observed in several incidences of toxicosis actually drinking from such sources. Such baths are also a potential danger for working dogs.</p>
					<h4><a href="ZnTher.html">Zinc in facial eczema control</a></h4>
					<p>The now widespread use of zinc oxide and occasionally by mistake, zinc sulphate for the prevention of facial eczema and lupinosis, has lead to reports of stock losses following such therapy. Details of the use of this treatment are given <a href="ZnTher.html">here</a>, but it is remarkable that so far more severe losses have not occurred. This is probably due to the predominant use of the oxide which is a relatively insoluble form of zinc.</p>
					<h4>Galvanized iron</h4>
					<p>Zinc is found in galvanized iron and in zinc chlorideflux used in plumbing and soldering. As zinc is soluble in organic acids, galvanized pipes are unsuitable for the transport of soft water and particularly milk. The latter was the reason for zinc toxicity reported in growing pigs in New Zealand in 1936. Galvanized metal trays used in mink cages have also been a source of toxicosis.</p>
					<p>Zinc is also found in some paints, particularly anticorrosion paints that may contain up to 50% of zinc as zinc oxide or zinc carbonate. Toxicity has been reported in a variety of animals which have chewed the wires of cages painted with such material.</p>
					<p>Pasture contamination from industrial practice has been the cause of animal poisoning. The fumes from brass foundries and other metallurgical works contain zinc oxide, zinc chloride and zinc sulphate.</p>
					<h4>Medicinal sources</h4>
					<p>Zinc sulphate has been used as an emetic. Zinc acetateand zinc benzoatehave been used as internal astringents and zinc phosphateas a rodenticide. Zinc oxide is a common component of medicinal ointments.</p>
					<h4>Zinc in feed stuffs</h4>
					<p>Zinc salts have been used as feed supplements for poultry and pigs to prevent parakeratosis.</p>
					<h4>Zinc Time Capsules</h4>
					<p>These capsules contain zinc oxide with a releasing agent to allow for slow release over an extended period of time. The capsule comes with different quantities of zinc oxide depending on the species and weight. The boluses should only be used on the species designated on the package as the formulation is different between sheep and cattle. It is important to use the correct bolus for the weight of the animal. Underweight animals may develop zinc toxicity. The period of protection and treatment interval varies for sheep (6 weeks) and cattle (five weeks). The maximum number of treatments in one season is three boluses.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>The mode of action of zinc is due to its high affinity for glands containing nitrogen and sulphur molecules. Zinc compounds precipitate proteins and this action is responsible for the production of gastroenteritis. High zinc concentrations also alter the metabolism of copper and iron in ruminants.</p>
					<p>Zinc does not accumulate in the body. Poisoning is the result of high doses of zinc and even when acute zinc toxicosis is not produced, abomasal damage, anorexia and reduced production may occur.</p>
					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>About 10% of ingested zinc may be absorbed through the gut. Young animals absorb more zinc than adults and more zinc is absorbed if the gastric mucosa is damaged. The amount of zinc actually available for absorption is influenced by several dietary factors. Vegetable fibre, phytates, cadmium, iron, calcium, copper and lead all reduce the intestinal absorption of zinc. The majority of zinc is absorbed in the small intestine (monogastrics) and the rumen, abomasum and small intestine of ruminants.</p>
					<p>An important property of zinc is that when it comes in contact with the pharyngeal mucosa, it stimulates the closure of the reticular groove, so that liquid travels directly to the abomasum.</p>
					<p>Highly concentrated zinc solutions cause severe gastroenteritis, due to protein denaturation. This damage to the gastric mucosa allows greater absorption of zinc and toxicity to occur. The latent period before the reticular groove reflex operates, varies in individual sheep. This may explain the wide response of sheep to high doses of oral zinc. Sheep can tolerate high concentrations of zinc solutions, if given by ruminal intubation.</p>
					<p>Zinc is widely distributed to all body tissues. It is found in high levels in the pancreas, liver, hypophysis, kidney, adrenal gland, testes and accessory male sex organs, bones, teeth, skin and hair. The highest concentrations are found in the eye.</p>
					</p>After dosing, zinc residues may remain high in some visceral organs for up to 14 days. These animals should not be slaughtered for 2-3 weeks after the last dose of zinc has been given. Zinc levels in milk rise after zinc dosing and copper and iron accumulates in the kidneys after zinc intoxication.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>Acute toxicosis with zinc produces very similar signs to poisoning with other metals. These include:
					<ul>
						<li>violent and painful vomiting (monogastric species)</li>
						<li>purgation and severe abdominal pain</li>
						<li>dehydration</li>
						<li>increased cardinal signs (increased pulse, respiration and temperature).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If the animal survives, anorexia, weight loss, haemoglobinuria and a haemolytic syndrome may develop. Other signs recorded in specific species include.</p>
					<h4>Pigs</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Unthriftiness and rough coat</li>
						<li>Stiffness and lameness</li>
						<li>Enlargement of joints, particularly the shoulder joints</li>
						<li>Sudden death due to spontaneous rupture of the aorta. This is thought to be due to copper inhibition with the formation of faulty elastin.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Dairy Cattle</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Chronic constipation</li>
						<li>Reduced milk yield.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Fitches</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>posterior paresis</li>
						<li>anaemia</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<h4>Cattle</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Pulmonary emphysema</li>
						<li>Pale flabby myocardium</li>
						<li>Necrotising abomasitis</li>
						<li>Kidney haemorrhage</li>
						<li>Degenerative liver changes</li>
						<li>Mucosa of the abomasum and duodenum is often lime green in colour and necrotic.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Pancreatitis is reported in sheep.</p>
					<h4>Pigs</h4>
					<p>In chronic zinc poisoning of pigs there is a non specific degenerative arthritis affecting particularly the head of the humerus.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>Analysis of the tissues and body fluids will confirm that zinc has been consumed, but may not necessarily establish that death was due to zinc poisoning. Specimens required from the dead animal include fresh and fixed liver, kidney, stomach contents and feed if available. Levels reported in cattle, pigs and poultry are given below.</p>

					<h2>Zinc Chromate Poisoning</h2>
					<p>Deaths have been reported in New Zealand cattle that had had access to zinc chromate paste. This paste has been used to pack joints in steel cored aluminium power conductors or cross country transmission lines. On analysis the paste was shown to contain zinc and chromium in a linseed oil base. The paste caused acute and chronic toxicosis with the main symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Deaths were often sudden, but chronically affected animals developed a wasting syndrome with chronic diarrhoea and died after several days and up to 4 weeks. Either zinc and/or chromium could have contributed to these losses.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Treatment is difficult. The initial aim should be to reduce the further absorption of the zinc compound. For dogs and cats emetics may be administered and laxatives to empty the gastrointestinal tract if ingestion has occurred within the last few hours.</p>
					<p>Sodium bicarbonate (1%), tannic acidand egg white can be administered to form insoluble complexes with zinc. Symptomatic treatment and good nursing are essential.</p>
