		<h1>Glyphosate</h1>
					<p>This is probably the most widely used herbicide in NZ. It has a high degree of mobility following entry into the foliage and is effective for controlling grasses and most perennial weeds, provided there is no rain within a few hours of application. It is quickly biodegraded once in contact with the soil. Earthworms rapidly disappear from ground that has been constantly sprayed with glyphosate.</p>
					<p>It is widely used before cultivation for pasture renewal, and some farmers graze sprayed pasture.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Roundup and many proprietary products. </p>
					<h2 id="struct">Structure and formulation</h2>
					<p>There are a variety of salts available, all aimed at faster uptake into the plants. In NZ, it is usually mixed with a penetrant to enable it to be taken up by plants before it is washed off by rain.
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>The active ingredient is practically non toxic at normal exposure levels and the absence of acute effects may relate to glyphosate's prime mode of action on the shikimic acid pathway, which is absent in animals. It has little or no subacute, chronic or neurotoxic effects and carcinogenetic tests have proved negative. No metabolites have been found in meat, eggs, milk or fat after standard testing for residues. The penetrants and surfactants are probably more toxic than the glyphosate.</p>
					<p>Poisonous plants sprayed with glyphosate may become more palatable as they wilt, and cause toxicity.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p> Accidental ingestion of undiluted material could potentially lead to elevated temperature, asphyxial convulsions and death.
