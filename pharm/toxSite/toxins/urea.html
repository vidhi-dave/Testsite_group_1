		<h1>Urea</h1>
					<p>Urea is used under a variety of circumstances as a fertilizer to boost pasture production. It has also been used as a feed additive for ruminants to provide a cheap non protein nitrogen (NPN) supplement. The ammonia produced by the breakdown of urea is utilized by rumen bacteria in forming their own cellular protein and this is available to the ruminant host when the bacterial cells are digested.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>The majority of poisoning cases result from ruminants gaining access to large quantities of urea in feed either from incorrect measurement or improper mixing of rations. Animals are usually poisoned before they become accustomed to urea in their diet. Initially a low level of urea should be added to feed and adjusted as the animals develop a tolerance. Urea is no longer fed to cattle in NZ.</p>
					<p>Cattle have also been poisoned from feed blocks containing an excess of urea and when urea mixed in water dispensers has been released at too high a level.</p>
					<p>Cattle have also been poisoned when given access to pasture which has been recently topdressed with urea.Hungry animals are also at greater risk - they will eat urea out of the bag.</p>
					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>In the rumen, urea is broken down by the enzyme urease to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide. Urease has a temperature optimum of 49&#x02DA;C and a pH optimum activity of 7.7-8.0. After deposition of a dose of urea into the rumen, peak levels of ammonia are reached within 30 minutes to 2 hours. Under favourable conditions of adaptation on the part of the ruminal microbial population, the ammonia formed is converted to microbial protein. Where this adaptation is not efficient or the amount of ammonia is too great, the latter will be absorbed from the rumen and small intestine into the bloodstream. Where the ruminal pH is low, the ammonia will be mostly in the form of ammonium ions. The latter are less well absorbed than the ammonia gas, which is unchanged and readily passes through lipoprotein membranes.</p>
					<p>Ammonia present in the portal blood is carried to the liver, where it is normally converted to urea once more through the action of the urea cycle. The urea is then excreted in the urine or recycled back into the saliva or back across the rumen wall. If the capacity of the urea cycle in the liver to convert ammonia is exceeded, the concentration of ammonia in the peripheral blood will rise. When this level rises to between 13 and 20 &micro;g/mL signs of toxicity will appear. Death will almost certainly occur when the blood ammonia level reaches 50 &micro;g/mL.</p>
					<p>High blood ammonia levels appear to have a marked effect on the animal's homeostatic mechanisms and general metabolic condition. For example, in acute toxicity leading to death, increases can be expected in packed cell volume, blood ammonia, hydrogen ion concentration and glucose as well as serum urea, calcium magnesium, potassium and phosphate. A respiratory acidosis results and death occurs due to inhibition of the respiratory centre.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>Signs of toxicity develop very quickly following the ingestion of excess urea and will usually appear in from 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
					<p>There is severe abdominal pain, shivering, staggering, forced rapid respiration and a marked jugular pulse. Prior to death in cattle there may be bellowing and violent struggling. Ammoniacal poisoning has been referred to in cattle as the &quot;bovine bonkers&quot; syndrome. Other symptoms include tetany, bloating, salivation and hyperthermia. Regurgitation of rumen contents is also seen frequently in sheep.</p>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>An early autopsy will reveal generalised congestion of the carcass, with engorgement of the peripheral blood vessels, excess serous fluid in the pericardial sac, pulmonary oedema with excess white stable froth in the trachea and bronchi. The rumen pH will usually be above 7.5. Animals dying from urea poisoning tend to be very bloated and decompose rapidly.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>The diagnosis is based on a feeding history and relationship between the time of feeding and the onset of clinical signs. There may be a strong ammonia smell of the rumen contents. Blood collected for ammonia analysis must be frozen immediately and kept frozen until analysed. Alternatively it can be preserved with saturated mercuric chloride which will inhibit enzyme activity.</p>
					<p>Feed analysis may also be carried out. This may be important in the case of propriety feeds and the possibility of litigation.</p>
					<p>Clinical pathology changes include increases in packed cell volume, blood ammonia, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, serum potassium and phosphorus and SGPT. Blood pH and urine production are decreased.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Treatment is unsatisfactory in advanced cases but is worthwhile in the prodromal phase in particular. Animals should be drenched or tubed with copious amounts of cold water; up to 40L for an adult cow. This should be followed by up to 12 L of 5% acetic acid. These treatments dilute the reaction medium, alter the pH and reduce the temperature, thus producing unfavourable conditions for the activity of urease. Household vinegar and sugar mixed together are also a useful treatment. The sugars are fermented to butyric, acetic and propionic acid which also assist the arrest of urease activity.</p>
					<h2 id="prev">Prevention</h2>
					<p>The concentration of urea in a diet must be carefully measured and never be more than 2-3% on a dry matter basis. The mixture must be even and animals must not be introduced to urea supplements suddenly or when hungry or debilitated. Avoid grazing pastures recently topdressed with urea.</p>
