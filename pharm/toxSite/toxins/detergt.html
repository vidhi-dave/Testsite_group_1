		<h1>Detergents</h1>
					<p>The term detergent is used to identify synthetic surface active compounds. They consist of an organic hydrophobic moiety attached to an hydrophilic group such as a sulfonate. Detergents are classified by the charge on the surface active ions (hydrophilic groups) at neutral pH, namely anionics, cationics, non ionics and Zwitter ionics. Anionic detergents carry a negatively charged surface active ion, cationics have a positive charge, nonionics carry no charge, and Zwitter ionics (amphoteric) have both positive and negative charges.</p>
					<h2 id="anionic">Anionic detergents</h2>
					<p>Anionic detergents are used mainly in household products such as laundry detergents, dish soaps and shampoos. The linear alkyl sulfonates (LAS) have the greatest use and are favoured over the branched chain alkyl sulfonates because of more rapid biodegradation in sewage treatment plants.</p>
					<p>These are of a low order of toxicity, they are strongly emetic in effect and generally considered not dangerous. They are absorbed percutaneously and from the gastrointestinal tract. They are detoxified in the liver and excreted primarily via the kidneys. In very high doses they may cause intravascular haemolysis.</p>
					<p>Treatment of intoxication is the same as for <a href="soap.html#treat">soaps</a>.</p>
					<h2 id="cationic">Cationic detergents</h2>
					<p>Cationic detergents, including the quaternary ammonium compounds, are used as fabric softeners, antiseptic agents and disinfectants and sanitisers. Cationic detergents have industrial uses as rust inhibitors in petroleum products, in ore flotation and as emulsifying agents in asphalt. Intoxication with these is not commonly reported.
					<p>Commonly encountered agents include benzalkonium, cetrimide and cetylpyridium.</p>
					<p>Cationic detergents may produce both acute and delayed toxic syndromes. They are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but chyme (partially digested gastrointestinal content) greatly reduces toxicity primarily by forming complexes which reduce absorption. Dosing with milk and other foods reduces oral toxicity. Percutaneous absorption is minimal, but skin trauma such as in a burn will greatly increase absorption.</p>
					<p>The majority of quaternary ammonia compounds have a curare
like activity. In acute exposures, CNS depression and seizures have been attributed to these curare like effects. Some cationics have topical anaesthetic properties, and ocular contact may result in corneal injury and may not be readily apparent due to loss of the pain sensation.</p>
					<p>The most significant findings in long term toxicity studies have been gastrointestinal irritation and enlargement of the large bowel.</p>
					<p>Many people develop skin irritation in response to exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds.</p>
					<h3>Clinical Features</h3>
					<p>Clinical signs may include salivation, vomiting, muscular weakness, depression and seizures. The vomiting of blood may occur.</p>
					<p>The quaternary ammonium compounds may mimic intoxication by the organophosphorus insecticides. Muscle weakness may also occur with ptosis of the eyelids and depressed respiration.</p>
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Within two hours of exposure, forced <a href="../treat.html#vetVom">vomition</a> is indicated, followed by dosing with milk, eggwhite or gelatin. In skin contact, washing with water is essential and when the eyes have been affected they should be treated promptly with isothermic, isotonic saline washing.</p>
					<h2 id="nonionic">Non
ionic and amphoteric detergents</h2>
					<p>The majority of nonionic detergents are of a low order of toxicity. <a href="bloatRem.html">Bloat remedies</a> are the most commonly encountered. The amphoteric detergents do not have common use in household detergents.</p>
					<h2 id="dishwasher">Dishwasher detergents</h2>
					<p>Small animals may ingest dishwasher detergents when they walk over floor spills or otherwise gain access to this material.</p>
					<p>Dishwasher detergents are a complex mixture of anionic, nonionic and other detergents and builders. They range from moderately to very toxic. The primary toxic effect is due to the alkali burns inflicted by the builders. Treatment is similar to other detergents.</p>
					<h2 id="builders">Builders</h2>
					<p>Builders are added to detergents, especially granular detergents, to bind elements (calcium and magnesium) responsible for water hardness. The builders used are those which chelate calcium and magnesium and include polyphosphates especially tripolyphosphates. The other precipitating builders are sodium carbonate (solway soda, soda ash, nevite soda, sal soda, washing soda) sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) sodium sesquicarbonate, sodium silicate and sodium metasilicate. The latter is the most caustic builder. Oxalic acid and oxalate salts are also used in some commercial bleaches.</p>
					<p>Builders are toxic because they inflict caustic burns and induce hypocalcaemia by binding calcium. This latter effect particularly applies to oxalate, which is not only highly corrosive but is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has a high affinity for calcium. Hypocalcaemia and renal damage from precipitated oxalate crystals are a likely consequence of toxicosis.</p>
					<p>Clinical features can be deduced from what is written above and treatment is along similar lines to other detergents. Calcium may need to be given to reduce the effects of oxalate poisoning and diuresis will need to be induced.</p>
