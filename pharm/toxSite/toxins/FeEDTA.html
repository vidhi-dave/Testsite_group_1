		<h1>Iron EDTA</h1>
					<p>The development and marketing of iron EDTA (ferric sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) as a molluscicide promises to reduce the accidental poisoning of dogs and cats with metaldehyde and methiocarb. Over time this product is likely to replace the latter materials not only because it is &ldquo;gardener friendly&rdquo; but it is claimed to be a more effective molluscicide.</p>
					<p>Iron EDTA only poses a toxicity risk to birds and mammals at very high doses. However, it is highly toxic to slugs and snails at low levels because it interferes with oxygen uptake and transport. Unlike mammals and birds, slugs and snails use a cuproglobulin moiety, haemocyanin, instead of haemoglobin for oxygen transport. Ferric ions interfere with oxygen uptake by the haemocyanin much as carbon monoxide interferes with oxygen uptake by the haemoglobin. This action is fatal to slugs and snails but not to mammals which use haemoglobin. Further iron toxicity in mammals is rare, but even if enough is ingested to be toxic, deferoxamine, an iron chelator, may be used to treat the toxicity. The iron EDTA complex is a selective toxin.</p>
					<p>Iron EDTA is marketed as a brown bran based pellet. It is claimed to have distinct advantages over metaldehyde and methiocarb other than its selective toxicity. These include, in particular, the fact that it has little or no effect on the environment. It does not harm birds, hedgehogs nor earthworms. It leaves no soil residues and temperature and moisture do not change its effects.</p>
