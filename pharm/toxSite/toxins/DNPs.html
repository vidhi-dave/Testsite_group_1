		<h1>Dinitrophenols (substituted phenols)</h1>
					<p>These include 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP) 2,4
dinitroorthocresol (DNOC) and dinitrobutylphenol (dinoseb, DNBP) and dinex. They are no longer registered but may still be encountered.</p>
					<p>Although the main risk to animals is through contamination of food and water, these desiccant selective herbicides are potentially very dangerous chemicals because they may be absorbed easily through the lungs, the gut or intact skin and they are persistent.</p>

					<h2 id="pathop">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>This group of chemicals acts by &quot;uncoupling&quot; oxidative phosphorylation; in so doing they stimulate tissue respiration and impair the synthesis of ATP. The resulting acceleration of metabolism results in weakness, fatigue and profuse sweating followed by collapse and death. High environmental temperatures increase the toxicity of DNOC. </p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>Weakness, fatigue and profuse sweating followed by collapse and death.In animals which recover from poisoning, the dyestuffs persist and yellow or orange coloration of the skin, hair, wool and feathers and sclera may be seen for weeks or months after exposure. The urine is yellowish green in colour.
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>Rigor mortis develops quickly and is pronounced.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Poisoned animals should be kept cool: dehydration must be combatted and sedatives other than barbiturates or chlorpromazine used as these potentiate the toxic action of DNOC.</p>
					<p>Other treatments include oxygen inhalation and the intravenous injection of 10ml of 2.5% solution of sodium methyl thiouracil (Human). This is said to reduce the basal metabolic rate rapidly.</p>
