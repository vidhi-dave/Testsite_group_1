  <h1>Chlorinated Phenoxy Weedkillers</h1>
  <p>These include 2, 4 D (2, 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ), 2,4,5 T (2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid ), MCPA or MCP (2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 2,4, DB (2,4dichlorophenoxybutyric acid). Others include dichlorprop, mecoprop and silvex.</p>
  <p>Dogs, horses, poultry, cattle and sheep have all been reported to be affected in NZ.</p>
  <h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
  <p>These herbicides are widely used for the control of broad leafed weeds and some are effective against gorse, bracken fern and woody plants.</p>
  <h2 id="struct">Structure and Formulation</h2>

  <p class="caption">2,4D</p>
  <h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
  <p>The acute toxicity is 200 mg/kg in cattle, 100 mg/kg in pigs and the LD<sub>50</sub> in dogs is 100 mg/kg. The multiple lethal dose in dogs is 25 mg/kg for 6 days. Dogs can tolerate chronic exposure of 0.05% in the diet for up to 2 years with no adverse effects. A toxic multiple dose in cattle is 100 mg/kg for 10-30 days. 2, 4 D esters are less toxic than the amines.</p>
  <p>The dog is probably the most susceptible species to poisoning by these herbicides and poultry the least.</p>
  <h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
  <p>Ingested chlorinated phenoxy herbicides are rapidly absorbed in an acid pH. Dermal absorption is slower and incomplete. These herbicides are protein
    bound and rapidly distributed to liver, kidney and brain. They are concentrated from plasma in the kidneys and eliminated in the urine largely unchanged. Dogs appear to be less efficient at this excretion process, and that may account for the particular vulnerability of this species. Unlike other species they do not withstand chronic exposure well.</p>
  <p>The herbicide 2,4,5 T may undergo enterohepatic cycling.</p>
  <p>The mechanism of action chlorinated phenoxy herbicides is believed to be due to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The mechanism by which these herbicides cause myotonia is unknown. They appear to have a direct effect on muscle membranes causing irritability and rigidity followed by muscle paralysis.</p>
  <h2 id="signs"> Clinical signs</h2>
  <p>These compounds per se are probably comparatively harmless to mammals and cases of poisoning usually have had important predisposing features associated with them such as exposure to the concentrated herbicide.</p>
  <p>An important aspect of these herbicides is that the contaminant dioxin, TCDD, (2,3,7,8
    tetrachlorodibenzoparadioxin) is an inevitable byproduct of 2,4,5 T manufacture. Dioxin is one of the most toxic chemicals known. Since 1982 the TCDD level in 2,4,5 T has been regulated to a maximum of 0.01ppm. No humans have been known to die from TCDD contact, but the characteristic indicator of exposure is the rash called chloracne. There are however numerous allegations that exposure to 2,4,5 T has resulted in birth defects, miscarriages, cancer and debilitation.</p>
  <p>In animals, clinical signs and disease have been attributed to chlorinated phenoxy herbicides. The primary clinical signs are gastrointestinal haemorrhage, anorexia, bloat, intestinal carcinoma (especially sheep), rumen atony, diarrhoea and oral mucosal ulceration. Some of the reported signs in animals following a moderately toxic dose include vomiting and diarrhoea. A more serious poisoning may be dominated by muscular effects such as posterior weakness, rigidity, myotonia, ataxia and reluctance to move. Convulsions and death may occur. Table 52 summarises some NZ cases of poisoning, animals affected, source and signs recorded.</p>

  <p>* nb picloram, (4 amino 3,5,6 trichloropicolinic acid, Tordon) from the picolinic acid group of herbicides is used in combination with triclopyr for the control of blackberry and other woody shrubs such as tutu, gorse and broom.&nbsp; It also has a hazardous potential and its use has been associated with an increased prevalence of intestinal carcinoma in ewes in the South Island.</p>
  <h2 id="pm"> Post mortem signs </h2>
  <p>Usually no gross or microscopic lesions are found. Oral ulcers may be present. Sometimes gastrointestinal ulceration or rarely, congestion of the kidneys, hyperaemia of the lymph nodes or a congested, friable liver are observed.</p>
  <h2 id="diag"> Diagnosis </h2>
  <p>Laboratory diagnosis may include the chemical analysis of forages, stomach contents, urine or renal tissue for confirmation of phenoxy herbicides. </p>
					<p>Poisoned animals may have an increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) depending on liver, kidney and muscle damage. A hypocalcaemia, hypochloridaemia, lymphopaenia, neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia have been reported in a dog poisoned by MCPA.</p>
  <h2 id="diff"> Differential diagnosis </h2>
  <p></p>
  <h2 id="treat"> Treatment </h2>
  <p>There are no antidotes for chlorinated phenoxy herbicides. The treatment depends on the dose, route of exposure and clinical signs. Decontaminate by copious washing for dermal exposure and use activated charcoal and a saline cathartic for oral exposure. Alkalinising the urine will help dogs excrete the herbicide faster. Good nursing care and a bland diet should be provided.</p>
