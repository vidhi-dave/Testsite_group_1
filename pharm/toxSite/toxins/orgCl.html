		<h1>Organochlorines (Chlorinated Hydrocarbons)</h1>
					<p>The development of DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane) and lindane (gammexane, BHC, benzene hexachloride) in the 1940s started a new era of pest control. DDT and lindane belong to the chlorinated hydrocarbon and organochlorine group of compounds. These were once widely used as insecticides because the immediate and residual activity of the compounds was good, and except for sensitive animals (cats and neonates), the mammalian toxicity was low.</p>
					<p>These compounds are exceedingly persistent in the environment (except for endosulfan and perthane which are biodegradable). Their persistence is due to their resistance to microbial and chemical degradation especially when covered with soil. Consequently organochlorine and chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides are now largely banned from use in most countries, although insect resistance to pyrethrins may mean that they make a comeback in the tropics to reduce malaria
carrying mosquitos.</p>
					<p>In NZ the phasing out process began in 1961 when all organochlorine insecticides except lindane were prohibited as ingredients of animal remedies. DDT was totally banned in 1970.</p>
					<p>Almost all reported cases of poisoning with these compounds occurred through human error or misuse of the compound.</p>
					<p>Between 1955 and 1970, 156 cases of organochlorine toxicity were recorded in New Zealand.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Organochlorine products were available as a wide range of insecticides. They were used on livestock as dips and sprays (Dieldrinand Aldrin) and on pasture for grass grub control (DDT). The following is a list of organochlorines which were used in agriculture and horticulture.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>DDT
						<li>BHC
 a mixture of 5 isomers of which only the gamma isomer is an effective insecticide. BHC was traded as Gammexane, Benzene Hexachloride and Lindane (BHC of over 90% purity)<li>Aldrin (<i>in vivo</i> this is oxidized to dieldrin)
						<li>Dieldrin
						<li>Chlordane
						<li>Toxaphene
						<li>Methoxychlor(methoxy analogue of DDT)
						<li>DDD(TDE) (Closely related compound to DDT)
						<li>Isodrin
						<li>Endrin
						<li>Heptachlor
					</ul>
					<p>No organochlorine products are currently sold in New Zealand. Despite government efforts in recent years to encourage the disposal of old chemicals, some organochlorine products are likely to remain stored in sheds and are a potential hazard to animals. In other countries there are still reports of intoxication due to dieldrin, endrin and heptachlor. Products containing lindane (99%) which were on the New Zealand market, include magfoil, maggot oil, scrotum mange dressing, flea di shampoo, and various blowfly dressings.</p>
					<h2 id="struct">Structure and formulation</h2>
					<p>These compounds can be divided into three classes based on chemical structure:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the DDT group, which includes the related bis p chlorophenyl compounds and isomers, and the bis p methoxyphenyl compound (methoxychlor);</li>
						<li>the cyclodienegroup, which includes the banned aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane, endrin, heptachlor and endosulfan;</li>
						<li>a heterogenous group, which includes toxaphene, lindane and mirex.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These compounds are poorly water soluble, but have good solubility in oils and organic solvents. They were used as dusts, wettable powders, emulsions and suspensions, often in conjunction with an oily vehicle which facilitates the penetration of the compound through an intact skin. When the compounds are covered by soil, the half
life can be quite long.</p><br />

					<p>The half life can be reduced to weeks in many cases, if the compound is fully exposed to the elements, although the waxy coating of many plant materials will retain the pesticides.</p>
					<p>Contamination of the waterways with pesticides occurs through spillage, negligence and from run off following agricultural use. Organochlorines are toxic to fish which tend to concentrate these compounds within their tissues.</p>
					<p>Because of the long half life and fat storage in mammals, DDT &amp; metabolites, lindane, heptachlor and dieldrin have been detected in fat samples taken from animals at slaughter.</p>
					<p>In the late 1990s heptachlor and DDT (&amp; metabolites) levels were found to be above the MRLs for those compounds. In the following years residues were detected but they fell below the MRLs.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>All the organochlorine compounds are relatively insoluble in water but because of their fat solvency they are rapidly absorbed from oily solutions. They are absorbed through intact skin. Dieldrin is also absorbed from dry powder although more readily through the cuticle of insects than the skin of animals (hence the greater toxicity to insects). Benzenehexachloride, aldrin, dieldrin and chlordane are more readily absorbed through the skin than the other organochlorine compounds. Ingestion, inhalation, aspiration and percutaneous absorption are all possible means of entry of insecticides into the body. Irrespective of the route of entry the chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides with the exception of methoxychlor, are stored in body fat. The quantity stored relative to the quantity ingested varies from compound to compound e.g. DDT is readily stored even at levels as low as 1ppm in the diet. Of the isomers of BHC, the b compound is most readily stored.</p>
					<p>The time for which these compounds remain in tissues also varies e.g. DDT, b isomer of BHC and toxaphene may persist in body fat for over 3 months.</p>
					<p>Of the small part absorbed from the gut in man and rabbits, 75 to 80% is excreted in the urine. In cats the excretion of DDT is very poor, hence the toxicity of this compound to cats.</p>
					<p>One of the main reasons for banning the use of DDT and other organochlorine compounds was the fact that they were excreted readily in milk. As little as 7 to 8 ppm DDT on hay, for example, brought an immediate excretion level in milk of 3ppm in cows to which it was fed. Because of the greater solubility of DDT in fat, butter prepared from such milk could contain about 65ppm. Contamination of milk with DDT constituted a severe hazard both to man and young animals.</p>
					<p>DDT, TDE or DDD, methoxychlor and perthane have a low toxicity for mammals; the rest of the organochlorine compounds however are quite toxic and can cause both acute poisoning and because of their persistence in body fat, chronic poisoning, which is dependent upon the rate of removal of the insecticide from body fat. Hence animals with small amounts of body fat i.e. thin animals and young animals are more susceptible to poisoning than fat animals.</p>
					<p>The form of the insecticide also affects its toxicity; dipping is dangerous because the compound can enter the animal by all routes; ingestion, inhalation, aspiration, and percutaneously.</p>
					<p>Oily preparations are more toxic to use than aqueous solutions and powders are the safest form but dangerous when used on small animals because of their licking habits e.g. cats.</p>
					<p>Cyclodiene organochlorines are generally very toxic. The LD<sub>50</sub> for dogs is 15
65 mg/kg but for cattle and swine the LD<sub>50</sub> ranges from 20
100 mg/kg. Cats are very susceptible to these compounds. The LD<sub>50</sub> for endrin in the cat is 3
6 mg/kg.</p><br />

					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>Most cases of intoxication result from to feed contamination, animals ingesting sprayed foliage or the spilled product or water from an &quot;empty&quot; pesticide container. Chlorinated hydrocarbons can also be inhaled or absorbed percutaneously. The inherent stability and lipophilic nature of chlorinated hydrocarbons are responsible for the animal being exposed not only to acute toxicity but to the longer term risks. Material that accumulates in adipose tissue may be released during periods of stress, and cause delayed toxicity.</p>
					<p>Chlorinated hydrocarbons are poorly absorbed from the gut and the majority are excreted unchanged in the faeces. The dose which is absorbed into the bloodstream becomes bound to serum blood cell lipoproteins, serum albumin and also enters chylomicra. The majority will become stored in body fat (except for methoxychlor), and slowly excreted in urine and milk.</p>
					<p>The cyclodiene group act by competitively inhibiting GABA binding at its receptor. Heptachlor and lindane act similarly. The DDT type or diphenyl aliphatic organochlorines affect the sodium channels in the peripheral nerves and brain. Sodium inflow is enhanced and potassium outflow is inhibited resulting in a more positive charge inside the nerve membrane. This leads to an enhanced initiation of action potentials and an increase in the tendency for seizures. </p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<h3>Acute poisoning</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The more toxic compounds (BHC, aldrin, and dieldrin) are CNS stimulators and the following are the clinical signs usually presented.</li>
						<li>The onset of signs may occur within minutes to days with most animals showing signs within 24 hours.</li>
						<li>The signs may be progressive or explosive in nature.</li>
						<li>Apprehension and hypersensitivity or belligerence are usually the first signs seen.</li>
						<li> Blepharospasms (tonic spasm of the muscle that surrounds the eye, producing almost complete closure of the eyelids) and fasciculations (local contractions of muscles visible through the skin) of facial and cervical muscles are followed by:</li>
						<li>Clonic spasms of cervical muscles (rigidity and relaxation alternate) then those of the forequarters and finally the hindquarters, which shake violently.</li>
						<li>Concurrently with the appearance of spasms, the secretion of saliva increases with frantic chewing or champing movements and froth on the muzzle and lips. This excessive muscle activity leads to a marked pyrexia.</li>
						<li>As the effect of the insecticide increases animals may become frenzied and lose coordination, stumbling while walking. They may jump imaginary objects, move in circles and adopt abnormal postures (head between forelegs etc).</li>
						<li>Finally convulsions (clonic tonic), paddling, nystagmus, grinding of teeth, and groaning are seen. The body temperature in dogs may increase to 46&deg;C during these convulsions.</li>
						<li>Most animals relapse into a coma before death.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In some animals there is severe depression, drowsiness, partial loss of appetite (inappetance) and reluctance to move, emaciation, dehydration and death. A few animals may show an exaggerated response to sudden stimuli such as noise and movement.</p>
					<h3>Chronic poisoning</h3>
					<p>The signs of chronic poisoning are similar to those of acute toxicosis, but are slow in onset. They may be delayed several days from ingestion and absorption of the poison.</p>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>The carcass is often bruised, with lacerated skin. Rigor mortis is prominent due to the animal's convulsive activity. There is congestion and oedema of most of the organ systems, and haemorrhages on the heart and lungs. DDT and mirex cause severe liver damage. Otherwise the changes are quite non
specific.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>The diagnosis is based on the history, clinical and pathological findings and laboratory confirmation. As organochlorines are stored in body fat for long periods of time, a positive test is not necessarily diagnostic for the cause of intoxication. Brain tissue concentrations are better correlated to toxicosis, than organochlorine concentrations in body fat.</p>
					<p><strong>Antemortem specimens</strong></p>
					<p>A biopsy of perirenal fat may be used to detect traces of an absorbed organochlorine compound.</p>
					<p><strong>Postmortem specimens</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Body fat (omental or subcutaneous)</li>
						<li>Stomach contents</li>
						<li>Liver</li>
						<li>Kidney</li>
						<li>Poultry whole carcass.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>It should be noted that endosulfan is not stored in body fat, because it is rapidly metabolized. Specimens for analysis must be obtained from the animal in a fresh state.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Initially it is important to remove the source of intoxication and any of the toxin that has not been absorbed. If the route was dermal, the area must be thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water, or if it was oral then administer an emetic. If the animal is in a preconvulsive state, then use sedative doses of pentabarbitone (dogs), thiobarbituates (cats), to control the nervous and locomotory signs. Sedation for 24-48 hours also slowly reduces the body temperature. However, if the temperature is greater than 41-42&deg;C, then the body must be cooled rapidly to prevent brain damage. The use of the barbiturates must be carefully controlled, because the postconvulsive depressant effect of the organochlorine will add to the anaesthetic effect. Avoid barbiturates if the animal is already in a depressed state. CNS stimulants are contraindicated because the depression caused by the pesticides is due to overstimulation of the brain. Artificial ventilation with oxygen may be required.</p>
					<p>It has been suggested that activated charcoal should be given, regardless of the route to bind to any organochlorine excreted into the gut and so prevent the enterohepatic circulation of the compounds. It has been suggested that the administration of phenobarbitone (40 mg/kg) induces the production of hepatic microsomes in some animals, however the effectiveness for removing residues is minimal.</p>
					<p>Intravenously administered calcium borogluconate and glucose in saline, may reduce the liver damage and neutralize the effects of the preconvulsive hyperkalaemia. If the animal survives, the clinical signs will often be gone by 1-2 days, but the recovery may take weeks to months.</p>
