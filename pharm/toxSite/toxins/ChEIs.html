		<h1>Cholinesterase inhibitors</h1>
					<p><a href="OPs.html">Organophosphorus</a> compounds have been known for many years. It was their possible use as nerve gas during World War II which stimulated their production. The early organophosphorus compounds were extremely toxic. Tetraethyl pyrophosphate was the first substance used in agriculture followed by parathion.</p>
					<p>Of all the insecticides the <a href="OPs.html">organophosphates</a> and <a href="carbam.html">carbamates</a> are the most potent and are presented in the most diverse array of types and formulations. Many thousands of organophosphorus products have been synthesised by the chemical industry and more recently this trend has occurred in the production of carbamates. Both groups of insecticides have in common the ability to cause toxicity by inhibiting cholinesterase, but differences in structure between organophosphates and carbamates and between individual compounds have produced subtle but diagnostically and therapeutically important variations in the clinical effects and responses to treatment seen in field toxicities.</p>
					<p>Their widespread use in agriculture has led to many animals deaths and in rare instances very serious losses have been incurred. Even as recently as 1997 a NZ report from Palmerston North Animal Health Laboratory described the loss of 61 Jersey heifers out of 200 which gained access to water contaminated with fensulphothion.</p>
					<p>During the Cold War, organophosphate nerve gases were the mainstay of chemical warfare, and huge stockpiles were built up. Nerve gases have been used in terrorist attacks in Japan, and there is always the (hopefully remote) chance of similar incidents here.</p>
