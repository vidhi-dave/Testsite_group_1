		<h1>Zinc Phosphide</h1>
					<p>Zinc phosphide is used internationally against rodents and other mammalian pests. Its main use in New Zealand is likely to be as an adjunct poison to 1080 for possum control.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Zinc phosphide, Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, is usually formulated as 0.5%-10% in baits, pastes and tracking powders. Phosphides are also used as insecticidal grain fumigants.</p>
					<p>Most preparations are unstable and break down in several days in a wet or humid environment. Secondary poisoning is only likely to occur in animals eating the gastrointestinal tract of prey very recently exposed to the toxicant. This has been recorded in dogs.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>All species are sensitive, although birds are probably the most sensitive. The rapidity of phosphine release is an important determinant of toxicity, which is enhanced by a low stomach pH. The LD50 in dogs is 40mg/kg and the lethal doses in dogs, cats and most farm animals is 20-40mg/kg. Theoretically, species which are able to vomit the poison protect themselves by doing so.</p>
					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>In the stomach acid, zinc phosphide rapidly breaks down to the toxic gas phosphine, which is also absorbed very quickly. If ingested on an empty stomach (pH&gt;5) very little phosphine is generated thus toxicity is reduced..</p>
					<p>Phosphine is an extremely irritating cytotoxic gas, primarily affecting the heart, liver, lungs and kidneys. Phosphine also causes non-specific depression of the haemopoietic system resulting in anaemia. The predominant cause of death is pulmonary oedema and tissue anoxia.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>The occurrence, speed of onset and severity of clinical signs is dose-dependent. Lethal doses induce signs within 15 minutes to 4 hours after ingestion, rarely up to 18 hours. Animals usually die in 3-5 hours.</p>
					<p>The main signs, which are not necessarily specific are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Vomiting, sometimes with blood, common in dogs</li>
						<li>Severe depression and weakness, but there may be CNS signs of vocalization (barking) wild running and snapping if handled</li>
						<li>Respiration becomes rapid and noisy (lung oedema)</li>
						<li>Tremor, hyperaesthesia, salivation, extensor rigidity and seizures may also occur</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>Necropsy changes seen are non-specific. There may be congestion and oedema in the lungs, pale yellow liver and fatty kidney. Histopathological signs in these organs are in line with the gross pathology.</p>
					<p>Freshly opened stomach contents may have a characteristic acetylene or fishy smell. </p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>Stomach contents or vomitus can be analysed for phosphide by a rapid qualitative test. Excess zinc can also be determined in the blood as well as the stomach contents.</p>
					<h2 id="diff">Differential Diagnoses</h2>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>There is no antidote to zinc phosphide poisoning, so treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If ingestion was recent and vomiting has not occurred, it can be induced. Also activated charcoal should be given</li>
						<li>The stomach pH should be elevated by orally administering 50ml of 3%-5% sodium bicarbonate</li>
						<li>Mineral oil, which solubilises the toxicant, prevents absorption, and acts as a cathartic, can be given orally at 1.5ml/kg</li>
						<li>Gastric lavage using 50-150 ml of 0.02% potassium permanganate may convert the phosphide to harmless phosphate</li>
						<li>Fluid therapy to correct the metabolic acidosis, hypocalcaemia and shock may be given</li>
						<li>Respiratory distress should be dealt with by oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation. If lung oedema is suspected, and there is no hypovolaemia, the diuretic frusemide may help. A blood transfusion may be indicated</li>
						<li>Other supportive therapy may include pain control, vitamins if liver damage is suspected and even special diets</li>
						<li>Monitor clinical pathology parameters including electrolytes, renal and liver function, acid-base status and calcium and glucose levels</li>
					</ul>
