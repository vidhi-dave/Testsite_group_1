		<h1>Squill</h1>
					<p>Scilliroside, a cardiac glycoside, is the active component of red squill, or the sea onion found growing in the Mediterranean. Although prohibited for use as a rodenticide in the UK in 1962, it has been associated with illness in several dogs in NZ which had access to scilliroside baits. Silmurin was marketed by Sandoz but it is no longer available. </p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>In NZ the rodenticide Silmurin was frequently mixed with chocolate milk powder to increase its palatablility and used as a rodenticide around dairy factories. Although the sea onion does not grow in NZ, there are a number of <i>Scilla</i> spp. and very similar plants grown in gardens. They are probably toxic.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>The reported illnesses in dogs is unfortunate as in general red squill is considered one of the safest rodenticides for general use. It is non
toxic for poultry and, when eaten it is usually vomited quickly, which reduces its absorption (the rat is incapable of vomiting). Very large amounts would have to be eaten by farm animals to prove toxic.</p>

					<p>In general it is most unpalatable unless mixed with sweet material, as described.</p>
					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>Scilliroside is thought to have a similar mechanism of action to <a href="../plantToxins/digit.html">digoxin</a>. It probably competes with K<sup>+</sup> for binding to the sodium pump in cardiac muscle cells.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>In three reported cases, the main clinical signs included vomiting, a rapidly increasing heart rate up to 120-180 beats per minute, cardiac arrhythmia and collapse.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Supportive treatment will enable the affected animal&rsquo;s body to detoxify scilliroside over time. The plasma half life of scilliroside is unknown but other cardiac glycosides have half lies of 14 to 48 hours in dogs. The main excretion is probably via the kidneys.</p>
					<p>Fluid therapy, sedation and phenytoin (Dilantin) for arrhythmias may be indicated. Fluid therapy should include the maintenance of a normal potassium level. Care should be taken not to overload the animal.</p>
					<h2 id="prog">Prognosis</h2>
					<p>With early diagnosis and careful treatment, the prognosis for recovery is good.</p>
