		<h1>Fluorine</h1>
					<p>Fluorine is present in all animal tissues with the highest concentrations in bone and teeth. Until recently it was considered that excessive amounts in the diet led essentially to two syndromes, acute and chronic fluoride intoxication. Acute poisoning is uncommon nowadays because fluoride is not used for medication (anthelmintic for pigs and poultry). However recent eruptions of Mount Ruapehu have contaminated large areas of pasture in New Zealand with volcanic ash that resulted in acute poisoning and death in cattle and sheep from fluorine toxicity. Chronic fluoride intoxication or fluorosis, is a condition that deserves considerable attention because of its effects on all species including humans.</p>
					<p>All domestic species and man can be affected by fluorine but pigs (acute fluoride intoxication) and cattle (fluorosis) are most commonly affected.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Sodium fluoride was used as a vermifuge for pigs and poultry. More effective and less toxic materials have now replaced its use.</p>
					<p><strong>Water </strong>Artesian waters in some parts of the world, notably Western Australia, have very high fluoride levels ranging from 0
14 ppm. The fluoride is released from fluoride granite rocks in underground conditions of high temperature and pressure and in the presence of high levels of sodium carbonate or bicarbonate. Fluorosis occurs when drinking water from such sources is concentrated due to high evaporation levels. Water levels may reach 30
40 ppm and herbage in such areas may also contain equivalent levels of fluorine.</p>
					<p><strong>Industrial contamination </strong>Industrial fluoride pollution is a major hazard to livestock and humans in certain parts of the world. An enormous amount of fluorine is emitted into the atmosphere from many smelter operations involving metallic extractions such as aluminium, steel processing, coal combustion for electric power production and phosphate rock processing.</p><br />

					<p>Of all the &quot;pollutants&quot; which affect farm animals fluorine has caused the most severe and widespread damage. The reason for the pollution being that fluorine is combined naturally with a number of minerals; some examples being cryolite (ALF<sub>3</sub> and 3NaF), silicas, and micas. Many New Zealand soils have high aluminium levels.</p>
					<p><strong>Fluoride in rock phosphate </strong><strong>and superphosphate </strong>Fluoride in rock phosphate is often particularly high. Phosphate from Morocco, parts of North and South America, China and Christmas Island may contain fluoride at 3 to 4 per cent. Ranges of 1-3% have been given for New Zealand superphosphate. The association of fluorine with superphosphate poisoning (acute) will be discussed under that heading.</p>
					<p><strong>Fluoride in phosphate used in dairy cattle rations
 </strong>Most supplements used in livestock rations, particularly in dairy cattle rations, are derived from rock phosphate sources, which as pointed out above may contain relatively high levels of fluorine. Significant amounts of this fluorine are available and absorbed by the animal. Fluorine is held in rock phosphate as calcium fluoride, which has over 50% of available fluoride.</p>
					<p><strong>Volcanic ash </strong>As mentioned, the fluorine content of volcanic ash can be sufficient to cause toxicity in both cattle and sheep. Eruptions from Mount Ruapehu in the central North Island of New Zealand are known to have contaminated pasture and caused fluorine toxicity over 100 km from the site of volcanic activity.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>Excessive amounts of fluoride (sodium fluoride)if given in dry food and contained in the gut long enough will produce severe gastrointestinal irritation due to soluble inorganic fluorides forming hydrofluoric acid in an acid environment. Fluoride is also known to delay the clotting time of blood.</p>
					<p>In acute fluorosis calcium metabolism is altered due to the formation of insoluble precipitates of fluoride and calcium, which leads to a lowering of plasma calcium. Fluoride binds to other cations (e.g. Mn<sup>++</sup> and Mg<sup>++</sup>)<sup> </sup>disrupting ionic balance as well as interfering with sodium and potassium ATPase. Hyperaesthesia and tetany may result. Death is the result of hyperkalaemia and conduction changes in the heart as well as hypocalcaemia.</p>
					<p>In chronic fluorine toxicosis, fluorine displaces hydroxyl groups from bone apatite to form fluoroapatite. Fluoroapatite turns over extremely slowly so that deposition of fluoride in bone is virtually permanent. Fluoride inhibits a wide range of enzymes in animal tissues including bone and the presence of high local levels of fluoride has a toxic effect on osteocytes, osteoblasts and odontoblasts. Depending on the species, fluoride can be responsible for marked osteodystrophy, particularly in parts of the skeleton where metabolic activity and remodelling processes are of greatest intensity e.g. the jaw of ruminants. Other target cells are the ameloblasts, the damage of which leads to faulty enamel formation.</p>
					<p>Fluoride in soluble form may also tie up dietary calcium in the gut reducing its availability to animals. This factor no doubt contributes extensively to the symptoms seen in chronic fluorosis.</p><br />

					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p><strong>Acute</strong> fluorine poisoning seen in pigs and ruminants causes gastroenteritis and hypocalcaemia. Signs include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>restlessness, salivation and dyspnoea
						<li>vomiting and abdominal pain;
						<li>diarrhoea;
						<li>muscle weakness, clonic convulsions, pulmonary congestion
						<li>cardiac failure, collapse and death.
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Subacute</strong> fluorine poisoning reported in cattle and sheep in New Zealand:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Anorexia and dehydration
						<li>recumbency and death after several days
						<li>azotaemia, electrolyte imbalance and acidosis.
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Chronic</strong> fluorine poisoning (fluorosis)has been recorded mainly in cattle but should be considered as a possible factor in severe dental defects seen in sheep in New Zealand from time to time. The key features include:
</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Marked lameness in cattle referred to as &quot;moving lameness&quot;. This is probably due to minor or major skeletal fractures particularly of bones of the hoof.
						<li>Skeletal abnormalities, including enlargement of the sternum and jaw and increased diameter of the metatarsal, metacarpal and pharyngeal bones and fractured ribs. Pain on palpation of all these bones is elicited.
						<li>Severe stunting in growth of young animals is recorded.
						<li>Severe dental abnormalities including severe wear of permanent teeth, delayed eruption of permanent teeth, enamel hypoplasia seen as mottling of the teeth, chalky whiteness of teeth but brown discolouration in some cases, chipping, breaking, broken mouth and severe dental pain leading to
<li>Difficulty in eating and cudding and even drinking, marked emaciation, fall in milk production and infertility.
					</ul>
					<h3>Clinical signs in other species.</h3>
					<p>Horses are less susceptible to fluorosis than either cattle or sheep. However dental anomalies and stiffness and lameness due to skeletal defects have all been reported.</p>
					<p>The following unpublished findings in laboratory animals and poultry occurred when superphosphate was accidentally used in place of limestone in several animal feeds. The rodent diet contained 550 ppm fluoride. Rats and mice had poor reproductive performance, which included, small litters, stillborns and neonatal death, low birth weights, maternal weight loss and death, stunted weanlings, diarrhoea, and abnormal incisor growth. Poultry (layers) stopped laying eggs. Rabbits and guinea pigs had abnormal wear of their molar teeth with entrapment of the tongue by the over grown teeth and weight loss.</p>
					<p>Of some significance is the condition of &quot;slobbers&quot; or chronic fluorosis which has been recorded in guinea
pig colonies from time to time. This has been associated with the feeding of high yielding fluoride rock phosphate as a phosphorus supplement to the guinea
pigs.</p>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>In acute fluorine poisoning the lesions seen are consistent with a severe gastroenteritis. In chronic fluorine poisoning or fluorosis the findings are consistent with those described under clinical symptoms, notably the dental defects with severe brown discolouration of teeth (cattle sheep), and mottling of teeth (enamel hypoplasia).</p>
					<p>Bone is often chalky white, brittle and exostoses, consistent with spontaneous fractures which have healed, are found in long bones and ribs. Necrotic bone is also frequently found, particularly in the jaw. Histopathologically severe bone changes consistent with osteoporosis are seen and the bone marrow shows gelatinous degeneration.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>Analysis of herbage and/or feed suspected of having been contaminated is essential. Also analysis of bone ash is indicative of excessive fluoride absorption if levels are above those listed in Table 15. There is a dearth of information about fluorine levels in New Zealand sheep but in Australia lambs considered to be suffering from severe fluorosis had bone ash levels of up to 7000 ppm. The reference value for nontoxic serum fluoride levels in sheep is less than 0.19 mg/l.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>The treatment of acute fluorosis may be warranted in some circumstances. The administration of calcium gluconate orally or aluminium or calcium compounds will bind fluorine before it is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Additional treatment depends on clinical signs and findings. Intravenous calcium may be necessary to replace precipitated calcium. Parenteral glucose is suggested as fluorine interferes with glucose metabolism. Aluminium sulphate (30 gm) daily has been used to prevent chronic fluorosis but it is not very palatable and higher doses may be required for treatment.</p>
					<p>The treatment of chronic fluorosis is impractical. Prevention involves identifying the source of fluorine and ensuring that livestock are removed to safe herbage or that the diet is corrected if phosphate supplements have been added.
