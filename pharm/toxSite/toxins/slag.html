		<h1>Basic Slag and Fly Ash</h1>
					<p>There are a number of reports of basic slag and fly ashpoisoning in cattle and sheep in NZ. Nine serious occurrences of slag poisoning were reported in 1988 with a morbidity rate from 2% to 100% and a mortality rate from 0% to 38%.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Basic slag is produced from the skim off the pot line in steel manufacture and is strongly basic. Since 1987 slag has been available from Glenbrook steel works in New Zealand and used as fertiliser. Since 1987 poisonings in cattle and sheep, particularly in the Waikato, have been attributed to this source.</p>
					<p>Fly ash is produced in coal fired furnaces and chimney stacks, where lime is burned with coal. The combustion of coal and limestone reduces sulphur emissions and converts limestone to quicklime and coal to ash. Slags are finely powdered, very dense and dark in colour, whereas the density of fly ash is low and the colour varies from white to grey. When exposed to air and moisture, fly ash forms aggregates up to 9cm with the consistency of mortar and remains stable in water and or pasture.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>All forms of slag and fly ash are generally high in iron and calcium content as well as a range of other minerals. In some analyses, New Zealand basic slag has been found to contain 1% to 2% vanadium. In a recent Swedish report, basic slag used as a fertiliser with 3% vanadium was incriminated as the cause of death. The significance of vanadium in New Zealand slag is not known. However, it is believed that one of the main toxic effects of both slag and fly ash is their very high pH which reduces and eventually stops fermentation in the rumen.</p>

					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>It is suggested that the cascade which follows ingestion of slag and fly ash begins with the overwhelming of the rumen buffers of volatile fatty acids, bicarbonate and phosphate. Alkalinity increases and fermentation decreases progressively and may cease entirely. Meanwhile the rumen remains filled with undigested food, digestion has ceased and the animals starve. Disturbances of the systemic cation anion balance appear; bicarbonate levels rise, chloride levels fall and the animal lapses into a severe metabolic alkalosis. Where the disorder is well advanced, protein values fall and liver failure probably commences, with a sudden arrest of energy supply, hepatocyte death and fibrous tissue replacement. The advanced pathology then appears to resemble lesions associated with sporidesmin and pyrrolizidine intoxication.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>The appearance of clinical signs may occur after a few days up to several weeks following access to pasture topdressed with either slag or fly ash. Losses may occur at any stage but also frequently happen over time, even up to three or four months. A good case history supplied by Dewes et al (1995) records a graphic picture of the seriousness of the problem as described for fly ash poisoning in the Waikato.
					<p>&ldquo;Two hundred and seventy (270) Friesian cows and heifers were due to calve between July and August, 1991. Fly ash was spread in three drops in mid April, 1991, at the rate of 1.0-1.5 tonnes per hectare. The cattle were dry, feed was short. Much of the ash was aggregated into 0.5cm to 2cm lumps.</p>
					<p>Within a few days of application some cows developed profuse diarrhoea. Within a month many cows had lost weight and weakened and some were lost in bogs. The first cow died within one week; by the end of June, 8 cows had died; by 30th September 51 had died.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Further cases from a surveillance report on basic slag toxicity states &ldquo;A herd of 120 Friesian cows strip grazed pasture on which only 25mm of rain had fallen in a month following fertilisation with basic slag. Four cows died and seven were euthanased. In an almost identical, but far more severe case, 115 cows either died or were selectively culled from a herd of 385.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>None of these reports mention the production losses or fate of surviving cattle.</p>
					<p>The main clinical signs are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Loss of appetite over time-some animals earlier than others.</li>
						<li>Severe depression.</li>
						<li>Colic.</li>
						<li>Profuse intractable watery diarrhoea, frequently containing blood.</li>
						<li>Severe loss of condition.</li>
						<li>Dehydration.</li>
						<li>General weakness, particularly of the hindquarters. Often found semi moribund in bogs, ditches, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>Post mortem descriptions are variable. In most cases the gastrointestinal tract is fluid filled, with distended small intestinal loops. Traces of slag aggregate may be found in some animals. Liver size varies from half to normal size. Frequently the borders are rounded and the parenchyma is firm and resistant to cutting.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>In most cases treatment is not an option. Mild cases may recover if removed from the source. Severely affected animals should be culled.</p>
					< id="prog">Prognosis</>
					<p>Some cattle do recover once they are removed from the source. Sheep and lambs may show similar signs, but lambs are said to be attracted to basic slag and as a result, deaths are frequent.</p>
