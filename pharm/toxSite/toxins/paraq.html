		<h1>Paraquat</h1>
					<p>Paraquat (1,1 dimethyl 4,4 bipyridylium dichloride) and diquat are bipyridyl herbicides which were widely used in agriculture and horticulture. They kill plants by contact with leaf surfaces and are quickly inactivated by absorption on to clay minerals. Any area which has been sprayed with these herbicides can be identified by the visible damage to plants which appears within 24-48 hours.</p>
					<p>Humans and all domestic species are susceptible to poisoning.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Most commercial formulations contain 10-20% paraquat ion and are marketed under a variety of trade names, Gramoxone, Pathclear and Reglone (diquat) being some common names used.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>Used properly both paraquat and diquat should present few hazards because of low application rates and decomposition. Unfortunately there have been a number of human tragedies associated with these herbicides and from time to time there have been reports of accidental and malicious poisoning of domestic animals.</p>
					<p>As little as 0.03% or 300ppm in the diet can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, and doses of 50 mg/kg bodyweight can cause acute intoxication. The concentrated 20% solution is corrosive to eyes and skin.</p><br />

					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>Paraquat and diquat are poorly absorbed from the alimentary tract (less than 20% of the administered dose). Paraquat accumulates in the lungs until the concentration is 10 times the level reached in other tissues. The absorbed dose is almost completely excreted in the urine within 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>Paraquat functions as a redox agent and contributes to the formation of oxygen free radicals and eventually causes lipid peroxidation. The typical course of poisoning is biphasic. Initially a transient renal and hepatic insufficiency is apparent, accompanied by pulmonary oedema.This is followed after a latent period by progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which results in death from respiratory failure.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<h3>Acute poisoning</h3>
					<p>Initially there may be violent vomiting, with the development of mouth and pharyngeal ulcers. Acute signs may include depression, dehydration, ataxia and diarrhoea. Large doses lead to hyperexcitability, convulsions and death within 24 hours. Oral doses near to the LD<sub>50</sub> may cause death at any time up to 10 days after dosing. In dogs a fairly rapid rise in blood urea levels during the first 2-3 days is associated with renal damage and this is accompanied by malaise.</p>
					<p>In most species respiratory difficulties develop after 2-5 days (by this time there is severe pulmonary congestion and oedema due to hyaline membrane formation and infiltration of inflammatory cells). Further respiratory embarrassment is associated with pulmonary fibrosis of a type that is typical for paraquat poisoning and as the animal (dog) becomes distressed, tachycardia and severe dyspnoea are the salient features.</p>
					<p>Radiographical features may be variable in cases of paraquat poisoning in dogs. In some there is evidence of pneumomediastinum and pulmonary oedema. Dogs become very dehydrated due to vomiting and decreased water intake. The prognosis is not good.</p>
					<h3>Chronic poisoning</h3>
					<p>Paraquat is rapidly absorbed on to green plants. Where cattle were put on to pasture immediately after spraying no toxic effects were seen but horses have been known to develop buccal irritation after 30 hours which progressed to severe ulceration and sloughing of the mucosa of the hard palate. In general sprayed pasture is unlikely to be dangerous because the chemical is firmly absorbed on to the grass and is not available in large amounts.</p>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>At autopsy the lungs are heavy, dark and rubbery, due to the severe congestion. There may be ecchymotic haemorrhages present, which coalesce to form large areas of haemorrhagic consolidation. There are few gross changes in the other organ systems.</p>
					<p>The early signs of respiratory distress can be associated with pulmonary haemorrhages and oedema, focal necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar collapse and the loss of the type I and II pneumocytes. As the disease progresses intra
alveolar fibrosis develops, together with bronchiolar epithelial regeneration and alveolar epithelization by immature type II pneumocytes. The kidneys may show focal areas of tubular necrosis throughout the renal cortices.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>There are no characteristic signs in the initial stages of the disease and an early diagnosis is based on the history of exposure. Most dogs are uraemic with renal granular casts and a proteinuria. Haematology may show a mild leucocytosis with a neutrophilia and monocytosis. Paraquat may be detected in the urine within the first 24 hours of ingestion, but most animals are not presented until the onset of clinical signs by which time paraquat is no longer detectable. For a quick screening test on urine within 24 hours of exposure, to 5 ml of urine add 100 mg of sodium bicarbonate and 100 mg of sodium dithionite. Paraquat gives a blue color. Up to 2 to 5 mg% may be detected without difficulty.</p>

A definitive diagnosis is usually made on the postmortem findings, rather than chemical analysis of tissue.
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Therapy must be initiated as soon as ingestion of the poison is suspected, regardless of whether there are any visible clinical signs.</p>
					<p><a href="../treat.html#vomVet">Emetics</a> should be given if the animal is presented early enough. All paraquat products obtainable in NZ must contain an emetic. Mineral <a href="../treat.html#adsorb">adsorbents</a> should be administered to inactivate the poison. These include bentonite, Fuller's earth (at 300 g/litre water given by stomach tube) or activated charcoal. Administering prochlorperazine to increase retention of these compounds has been suggested, followed by an enema or saline <a href="../treat.html#cath">cathartic</a> to hasten excretion. Forced diuresis during the first 24 hours may increase the rate of excretion of the compound. Dehydration is usually present and has to be treated.</p>
					<p>The use of oxygen is controversial. Many of the pathological changes within the lungs are similar to oxygen toxicosis, and it is believed that oxygen exacerbates the condition. Steroids and cytotoxic drugs have been used with inconsistent results. Selenium, N acetyl cysteine (Parvolex), ascorbic acid, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase and butylhydroxyltoluene (BHT) have been used successfully in experimentally produced paraquat toxicosis.Catalytic antioxidanta currently under investigation may eventually be the treatment of choice.</p>
					<h2 id="prog">Prognosis</h2>
					<p>Even if the patient survives after 24 hours, the prognosis is still guarded for the next 3
4 weeks.</p>
