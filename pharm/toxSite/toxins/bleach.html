		<h1>Bleach</h1>
					<p>Pet intoxication with bleaches is uncommon but cases have been reported.</p>
					<h2 id="struct">Structure and formulation</h2>
					<p>Liquid bleaches generally contain sodium hypochlorite 3 - 16%. In addition to their use as laundry agents, the chlorine bleaches are also used as <a href="disinf.html">disinfectants</a>.<p>Powdered bleaches may contain trichloro
isocyanuric acid, sodium perborate, sodium peroxides, laundry bluing, builders and detergents, fluorescent dye and aniline blue. Powdered bleaches are more concentrated and therefore more toxic than liquid bleaches.</p>
					<p>Chloramine is often added to town water supplies, but is very rarely a cause of poisoning.</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>The toxicity of hypochlorite is low and limited to corrosion of the skin and mucous membranes. The corrosive ability is determined by the available chlorine. When hypochlorite solutions are mixed with acids or ammonia solutions, free chlorine or chloramine gas is released. This can cause pulmonary irritation (chlorine gas was used for chemical warfare in WW1).
					<p>Trichloroisocyanuric acid dust can produce bronchospasm and pulmonary oedema.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>There are no distinct features of bleach intoxication.&nbsp; Animals may have a bleach (chlorine) odour and bleaching of the hair may occur.&nbsp; Other clinical signs may include salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain, and oedema of the glottis and larynx may be observed.&nbsp;
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Treatment of oral poisoning involves inducing <a href="../treat.html#vetVom">vomiting</a> and dosing subsequently with milk of magnesia (0.2 0.3 mg/Kg).&nbsp;Other <a href="../treat.html#demulc">demulcents</a> may be used as well. Dilution with water or milk may also be useful.</p>
					<p>If eyes were exposed, they should be irrigated with water or saline.</p>
					<p>If exposure to chlorine gas has occurred, oxygenation should be assessed, and oxygen given as necessary.</p>
