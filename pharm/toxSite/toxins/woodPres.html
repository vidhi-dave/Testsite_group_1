		<h1>Wood preservatives</h1>
					<p>The main timber preservative used out of doors in New Zealand is copper
 chrome <a href="arsenic.html">arsenic</a>. Other wood preservatives such as <a href="disinf.html#boron">borate</a> are only used for the treatment of timber to be used indoors and therefore are an unlikely stock hazard. <a href="#clNap">Chlorinated naphthalene</a> is now no longer used as a wood preservative, but its persistence in old timber it is still potentially a source of poisoning to animals. In the past it was responsible for the loss of and wasting in cattle in NZ so that brief reference to it is warranted. Creosote is rarely seen these days: it is similar to other <a href="disinf.html#phenol">phenolic</a> toxins.</p>
					<h2>Chlorinated naphthalene</h2>
					<p>The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1941 and because of its unknown aetiology it was called X disease. Latterly it was referred to as hyperkeratosis X. Subsequently it was found to be caused by one of the chlorinated naphthalene derivatives. The higher chlorinated analogues, pentachloronaphthalene and hexachloronaphthalenewere mainly responsible for the cause of this widespread chloracneiform dermatosis and other lesions in cattle.</p>
					<p>In NZ poisoning of cattle has been reported but all domestic animals are susceptible.</p>
					<h3>Sources</h3>
					<p>Pentachloronaphthaleneis particularly persistent in treated timber and once thoroughly treated, timber will resist invasion by termites and other wood boring insects, for many years. Very small amounts of the material may be detrimental to stock health. While the main source of chlorinated naphthalenes is in preserved timber it is also found in lubricating oils, floor varnishes, ceramics, electrical insulators and solvents.</p>
					<p>In NZ and Australia poisoning in cattle has been associated with environmental sump oil contamination and hay contaminated by chlorinated naphthalene </p>
					<h3>Toxicity and pathogenesis</h3>
					<p>There are similarities between the hyperkeratosis produced by chlorinated naphthalenes and that produced by vitamin A deficiency. Experimentally it has been found that plasma vitamin A levels decrease rapidly after feeding with a hyperkeratogenic agent and if carotene is administered at this time plasma carotene levels increase but plasma vitamin A does not. Therefore it has been postulated that chlorinated naphthalenes interfere with the conversion of carotene into vitamin A.</p>
					<p>A dose as small as 11
22 mg/kg of chlorinated naphthalene has produced symptoms in calves. In practice, poisoning is usually due to continued ingestion of small amounts of the substances over a period of time.</p>
					<h3>Clinical signs</h3>
					<p>The disease is often not particularly noticed until the skin lesions appear.</p>
					<p>In cattle clinical signs include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>listlessness and depression</li>
						<li>variable appetite (pica - pizzle sucking in calves)</li>
						<li>lachrymation and nasal discharge</li>
						<li>drooling of saliva</li>
						<li>red swollen areas in mouth and on muzzle</li>
						<li>polyuria</li>
						<li>loss of weight</li>
						<li>abortion in pregnant animals</li>
						<li>finally after 6-8 weeks the characteristic lesion of thickening and wrinkling of the skin develops (this is caused by a gradual accumulation of hard, keratinous material; the folds cannot be reduced by stretching the skin). The lesions are usually confined to the neck and withers but in extreme cases may cover the body.</li></ul>
					<p>Sheep do not show the skin lesions nor the excessive fall in plasma Vitamin A. There is weakness, loss of weight, loss of appetite, nasal discharge and ascites. Pigs do not show the characteristic lesions as seen in cattle. In kittens and dogs, lachrymation, conjunctivitis and general depression have been observed. Loss of hair is recorded in cats and dogs exposed to the vapour of wood preservatives.</p>
					<p>The external application of chlorinated naphthalenes gives rise to typical skin lesions but prolonged application is needed before internal changes are seen.</p>
					<h3>Differential diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Dermatophilosis, photosensitization and vitamin A deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p>
					<h3>Post mortem</h3>
					<p>Pathological changes include hyperkeratosis of the skin and hair follicles. In the oral cavity the papillary proliferations consist of irregular, thickened epithelium supported by strands of subepithelial connective tissue. Similar lesions are formed on the oesophageal mucosa and sometimes in the forestomachs. There are also nodular proliferative lesions affecting the mucosa of the large bile ducts and gall bladder, and ductular hyperplasia and portal fibrosis are sometimes present. The kidneys are enlarged and pale and microscopically there is tubular degeneration and dilatation with extensive interstitial fibrosis.</p>
					<p>In cattle, lesions of the reproductive tract are reported including, squamous metaplasia of the accessory sex glands and excretory ducts of the testes in the bull. In cows, metaplasia of the cervix and Gartner's ducts are reported.</p>
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>There is no effective treatment.</p>
					<h2>Pentachlorophenate</h2>
					<p>Sodium pentachlorophenate is a crystalline chemical similar to other phenols. It has been used as pesticide, bactericide, fungicide, molluscicide and insecticide. It was used as a timber preservative, but was banned in NZ in 1988.</p>
					<p>Sheep, cattle, poultry and cats have been affected.</p>
					<h3>Pathogenesis and clinical signs</h3>
					<p>Like the other substituted <a href="DNPs.html">phenols</a> it is a powerful uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and this is the cause of death in acute poisoning. The clinical features and pathological findings in PCP toxicity especially subacute or chronic toxicity, appear to be highly species dependent. Most features of poisoning are as for other phenols. Sodium pentachlorophenate ingested by poultry was the cause of chronic liver disease in poultry and was characterised by biliary cirrhosis.</p>
