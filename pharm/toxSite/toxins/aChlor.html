  <h1>Alpha Chloralose</h1>
<p>Alpha chloralose is occasionally used as a general anaesthetic for laboratory animals, as a rodenticide and has been used to immobilise depredating birds.</p>
<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
<p>In NZ it has been used on coastal airports where seagulls are in danger of causing air strike to planes landing and taking off. Alpha chloralose is sold in wheat, barley or pea bait and as a paste for the control of sparrows and other birds. The compound is the active ingredient of Pestoff or Alpha chloralose Baitor Paste. As a rodenticide, alpha chloralose should be used outside, as much of its effect is lost in warm buildings.</p>
<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
<p>All species are potentially at risk but significantly more cases occur in cats, dogs and birds.Dogs and cats can be poisoned secondarily by eating birds or rodents killed by alpha chloralose.</p>
<p>The LD<span class="sub">50</span> ranges from 42 mg/kg for a duck, 100 mg/kg for a cat and up to 600 mg/kg for a dog.
<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
<p>Alpha chloralose acts upon the central nervous system, and has both stimulant and depressive properties. Alpha chloralose selectively depresses neurons of the ascending reticular formation, suppressing the normal arousal response. At the same time small doses increase motor activity producing myoclonic movements, that progress to deep anaesthesia as the dosage increases. Alpha chloralose also reduces the body temperature so that its toxicity is particularly effective in small animals like mice which have a greater surface area/volume ratio.</p>
<p>Within the body, alpha chloralose is biotransformed to chloral, which is converted to trichlorethanol, then conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver and excreted in the urine as urochloralic acid. This is rapidly excreted and is not a cumulative poison.</p>
<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
<p>Initially there is a mild ataxia with poor coordination of movements. Hyperexcitability and aggressiveness are exhibited early in the toxicosis. Cats in particular will hiss, spit and claw the air with their front paws. Tonic convulsions develop and there are records of cats in a posture with the front legs extended as though attempting to cling to a moving object. In dogs salivation is seen and convulsions are of a more clonic nature.
<p>Affected animals lose sensitivity to pain and yet have increased reaction to touch, sound and other stimuli. The pupils are widely dilated.</p>
<p>Severe poisonings rapidly progress to weakness, shallow respirations, tonic convulsions and death from respiratory failure. However death is rare in domestic animals from accidental ingestion and with good nursing a favourable prognosis can usually be given.</p>
<p>Birds that ingest treated seed or paste with alpha chloralose may show clinical signs that include excitement followed by depression leading to deep anaesthesia and death.</p>
<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
<p>There are few reports of significant pathological changes or post mortem features in domestic animals. Lesions reported in seagulls include severe oedema of the lungs and some degree of amyloidosis of the spleen.</p>
<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Stomach contents, liver and urine samples may be sent for analysis. Forty
five percent of alpha chloralose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours of ingestion, and early samples may be useful if obtainable.</p>
<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
<p>Animals need to be restrained in well padded cages to prevent self injury. Warmth may need to be provided. Try to maintain body heat but avoid excessively high temperatures; 25&#45;28&deg;C is the ideal range.</p>
<p>Birds poisoned by alpha chloralose should be placed in a warm dark place, allowed to recover fully and then released.</p>
<p>Unless the animal is showing CNS signs, evacuation of the gastrointestinal tract by use of emetics, gastric lavage and laxatives should follow. Seizures may be controlled by diazepam and it may be necessary to administer oxygen by artificial ventilation.</p>
<p>Osmotic diuresis may be useful.</p>
