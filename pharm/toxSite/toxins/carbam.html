		<h1>Carbamates</h1>
					<p>Physostigmine, carbachol and bethanechol are carbamate esters occasionally used for therapeutic purposes. Physostigmine is found in the West African plant <i>Physostigma venenosum</i>. While these compounds are not insecticidal, a number of potent carbamate pesticides are available. The two of particular importance in agriculture and horticulture and veterinary medicine are carbaryl and methiocarb.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p><strong>Carbaryl </strong>1 naphthyl N methylcarbamate</p>
					<p>This is widely used as an orchard spray and has been used for ectoparasite control in cattle, sheep and goats. It is also included in several preparations to control ectoparasites in dogs and cats. Most toxicity due to carbaryl has been the result of careless treatment of animals with abnormally high levels of material.</p>
					<p><strong>Methiocarb </strong>4 methylthio 3, 5 xylyl N methylcarbamate</p>
					<p>This is commonly used in NZ as a <a href="mollcide.html">molluscicide</a> and is marketed as a blue pellet (Mesurol, Bayer). Dogs and cats can be easily poisoned by this material as with <a href="metald.html">metaldehyde</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>Promacyl </strong>3 isopropyl 5 methylphenyl N butyryl N methylcarbamate</p>
					<p>This has been used extensively as an acaricide and insecticide in the cattle industry in Australia.; The insect readily metabolises promacyl to highly toxic promecarb. The mammalian host is far less able to do this and rapidly hydrolyses the compound to inactive metabolites.</p>

					<p><strong>Propoxur</strong><strong> </strong>2 (1 Methylethoxy)phenol methylcarbamate</p>
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>The LD<sub>50</sub> of methiocarb for a dog is about 25 mg/kg of methiocarb. A 20 kg dog would have to eat approximately 25 grams of Mesurol containing 2% (20 g/kg) methiocarb to receive a fatal dose.</p>
					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>Carbamates are fairly potent inhibitors of cholinesterases. A significant difference in action between physostigmine and the synthetic insecticidal carbamates is that the former only inhibits choline esterase while the latter also inhibit hepatic and other carboxyl esterases. The carbamates react with acetylcholine esterase in exactly the same way as the <a href="OPs.html#pathoph">organophosphorus compounds</a>. However the main difference is that the carbamylated enzyme quickly reverts to active enzyme and there is a far greater dose needed to produce significant clinical effects than with the organophosphorus compounds.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<p>The clinical signs of carbamate toxicity are principally cholinergic and include, pupillary constriction, muscle fasciculations, emesis, diarrhoea and salivation. If the choline esterase activity is severely depressed, then the clinical signs may include severe depression, bradycardia, pulse irregularity, congested mucous membranes and very shallow respiration.
					<p>Animals which show signs of carbamate toxicity may recover completely in a few hours, while with the OPs recovery may not occur or take considerably longer.</p>
					<h2 id="diag">Diagnosis</h2>
					<p>The diagnosis is based on a history of access to the poison and the cholinergic clinical signs. In the case of methiocarb poisoning, the blue dye may be seen in the vomitus or diarrhoea.</p>

<p>Cholinesterase depression is labile with carbamate poisoning. Often the levels return to normal spontaneously before or during laboratory analysis.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>Treatment of affected animals consists of inducing <a href="../treat.html#vetVom">emesis</a> (with apomorphine) to remove any unabsorbed bait from the stomach. The animal must be fully conscious and have ingested the bait within a few hours. Atropine is the specific antidote for methiocarb and should be administered every ten minutes until signs of toxicity are controlled or atropinization is achieved. Atropinization is characterized by dry mucous membranes and pupillary dilation. Although intoxicated animals can tolerate larger doses of atropine than normal animals, the carbamate induced cholinesterase depression can be rapidly remedied. The patient then has the same tolerance to atropine as a normal dog, so overdosage with atropine must be avoided.</p>
					<p>In cases of respiratory embarrassment or failure, oxygen or artificial ventilation should be used. Sedatives should be avoided for their depressant effects on the respiratory centre of the central nervous system.</p>
					<p>The use of oxime compounds (pralidoxime) for the reactivation of acetylcholine esterase in carbamate toxicity is <strong>contraindicated</strong>. Pralidoxime does not react with the carbamoyl moiety of the inhibited enzyme but only binds to acetyl choline esterase at the ionic site, thus also rendering functional enzyme molecules temporarily inactive.</p>
					<h2 id="prog">Prognosis</h2>
					<p>Usually the acute signs of methiocarb intoxication last for only a few hours, but the patient may need several days to recover completely.</p>
