		<h1>Solvents</h1>
					<p>Fuel oils or petroleum products consist of a variety of hydrocarbon compounds including; petroleum naphthas, kerosene (paraffin oil), methanol, denatured alcohol etc.</p>
					<p>Such materials have been responsible for deaths in cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats and a variety of birds. Access to such materials can occur in many ways. Cattle in particular, when thirsty, have drunk fuel contaminated water with fatal results. Most toxicoses in small animals result from accidental skin contamination and as such they can present a serious treatment problem to the owner and the veterinarian.</p>
					<h2 id="source">Sources</h2>
					<p>Vehicle fuels, many industrial and household products.</p>
					<h2 id="struct">Structure and formulation</h2>
					<p>Mostly aromatic or aliphatic branched or straight chain hydrocarbons
					<h2 id="tox">Toxicity</h2>
					<p>Lighter oils, containing a higher proportion of volatile hydrocarbons, are considerably more toxic than heavy oils. The toxicity of oil may be affected by the presence in it of a variety of additives or impurities including sulphur, lead, chlorinated naphthalenes and triaryl phosphates.
					<p>Crude oil varies in the amount of kerosene, naphtha, and gasoline content. The toxicity correlates with the composition of the crude oil. Dosages of 48 ml/kg of sweet crude (high in gasoline, naphtha and kerosene), 56 ml/kg of kerosene, or 74 ml/kg of sour crude oil (high levels of gas oil, lubricating distillates, residue and sulphur result in toxicity.</p>
					<p> Refined petroleum products have different toxicities.</p>

					<h2 id="patho">Pathophysiology</h2>
					<p>Generally these are highly lipophilic compounds that are readily absorbed across intact skin and gastrointestinal mucosa. The volatile aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons are readily absorbed via the lungs.</p>
					<p>Some of these products are metabolised to phenols or carboxylic acids and conjugated with sulphates, glucuronides or glycine</p>
					<p>Crude and refined petroleum products are irritating to mucous membranes and skin. Upper respiratory irritation and aspiration pneumonia result from their irritant and volatile nature. They probably irritate by disrupting lipid cell membranes.</p>
					<h2 id="signs">Clinical signs</h2>
					<h3>Cattle and other ruminants</h3>
					<p>The main features are anorexia, depression and dehydration. This is followed by vomiting (regurgitation) weakness, collapse and death. Prior to collapse, incoordination may occur with shivering, head shaking and mental confusion.</p>
					<p>Bloat has been noted particularly after the ingestion of the volatile hydrocarbons such as petrol and probably due to the presence of naphtha. In some cases the faeces are dry and have a sweet kerosene
like odour.</p>
					<p>The most serious consequence of fuel oil poisoning is pneumonia due to aspiration of fuel or oil into the lungs. This may also become complicated by bacterial infection. The light hydrocarbons in particular, produce the most severe and fulminating form of pneumonia.</p>
					<h3>Small animals</h3>
					<p>As mentioned, irritation to the skin and mouth are serious signs in cats and dogs. Salivation, vomiting, diarrhoea, ataxia and dyspnoea may all be seen. As in large animals the terminal stages may be characterised by severe depression, tremors, seizures and coma. Kerosene and light hydrocarbons may also have nephrotoxic and cardiotoxic effects.</p>
					<p>As with large animals, aspiration pneumonia may occur initially or as a sequel to contamination of skin and hair.</p>
					<h2 id="pm">Post mortem</h2>
					<p>Severe pulmonary lesions are likely to be a main feature of the autopsy. In more chronic cases fatty degeneration of the liver and other organs may be found.</p>
					<h2 id="treat">Treatment</h2>
					<p>In small animals no attempt should be made to induce vomiting because of the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Gastric lavage is required followed by careful dosing with olive oil to dilute volatile hydrocarbons and diminish their rate of absorption.</p>
					<p>Full emergency therapy must be applied to sustain the animal if necessary. Contaminated skin and hair must be carefully cleaned with warm soapy water. Avoid the use of detergents. Solvents such as turpentine or kerosene for the removal of heavy oils are strictly contraindicated. Soft butter, margarine or cooking oil may be used to clean affected parts and should be wiped off with rags or paper tissues.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are also useful, particularly if there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.</p>
