			{
				ques: "Benzylpenicillin",
				ans: "excretion may be reduced by probenecid",
				ansSel: ["is effective when given orally", "is metabolised rapidly in the neonate", "is usually injected iv", "crosses the blood brain barrier easily"],
				ansInfo: ["Benzylpenicillin is rapidly inactivated in the stomach so is usually injected. However, It is quickly excreted by the kidney by a specific carrier which can be blocked using probenecid. Although it does not cross the normal blood brain barrier, if there is inflammation of the meninges it will cross, and is often used clinically for this reason."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Contra-indications for tetracyclines include",
				ans: "pregnancy",
				ansSel: ["neonatal animals", "pigs", "anaemia","Mycoplasma infection"],
				ansInfo: ["Tetracyclines bind to calcium and if given in late pregnancy or when the permanent teeth are growing will stain them yellow and may interfere with their growth. Neonates already have their milk teeth and are not yet growing their permanent teeth. Tetracyclines can cause fatal overgrowth of some gut bacteria in some species but not pigs."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Enrofloxacin",
				ans: "is effective against E. coli",
				ansSel: ["inhibits integrase 1", "is a prodrug for carbapenem", "is bacteriostatic at low doses but bactericidal at high doses", "is ineffective against Bacillus spp."],
				ansInfo: ["All the quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase, also known as topoisomerase II. Enrofloxacin is a prodrug for ciprofloxacin. Enrofloxacin is less effective at high doses. The reason for reduced activity at high doses is not clear, but may be because high doses stop protein transcription which is necessary for the drug to act. Enrofloxacin√ïs main use is to kill coliforms, which are normally very susceptible. It is usually ineffective against anaerobes and streps; some staphs and Pseudomonas quickly acquire resistance, but Bacillus spp. are usually susceptible."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Chloramphenicol",
				ans: "can cause depression of bone marrow function",
				ansSel: ["must be administered parenterally", "can be safely used in neonates", "does not penetrate the blood brain barrier", "can cause discolouration of developing teeth in pups"],
				ansInfo: ["Chloramphenicol is effective orally. It is particularly unsafe in neonates. It penetrates everywhere and has a wide range of side effects, including bone marrow depression. The effect on teeth is seen with tetracyclines."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Sulphonamides",
				ans: "are secreted into milk",
				ansSel: ["inhibit the incorporation of PABA into the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit", "antagonise the action of tolbutamide", "are excreted more rapidly in acid urine", "are bactericidal"],
				ansInfo: ["Sulphonamides block bacterial production of folic acid. Tolbutamide is an oral hypoglycaemic derived from sulphonamides, severe hypoglycaemia has occurred when the two are given together. On their own they are bacteriostatic. They are relatively lipid soluble and get into milk easily."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Streptomycin",
				ans: "may potentiate neuromuscular blockade",
				ansSel: ["may cause blindness", "is used to treat strangles", "is cardiotoxic", "should not be given to cats"],
				ansInfo: ["Streptomycin is particularly toxic to the sensory cells in the semicircular canals but can also cause deafness, not blindness. It interferes with acetylcholine release to potentiate neuromuscular blockade, although this is rarely clinically important. Streps are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides. It is nephrotoxic rather than cardiotoxic. There are no specific indications for it in cats but it is often given to them!."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Penicillins are generally useful against",
				ans: "Streptococcus equii",
				ansSel: ["Escherichia coli", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Brachyspira hyodysenteriae"],
				ansInfo: ["You will have to learn this sort of information. Bear in mind that it keeps changing as bacteria become resistant!"],
			},
			{
				ques: "Chlortetracycline",
				ans: "inhibits both Gram positive and negative bacteria",
				ansSel: ["may be given to gerbils in their drinking water", "is bactericidal", "should be given with milk in young animals", "has a zero withholding time in pigs"],
				ansInfo: ["Although chlortetracycline could be useful in gerbils, they do not drink so it has to be administered by another route. It binds to calcium so should not be given with milk. The withholding time is 7 - 10 days after oral administration to pigs, depending on the formulation."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Because the chances of resistance are too high, benzylpenicillin should not be used empirically in NZ to treat:",
				ans: "Staph. aureus mastitis in a cow",
				ansSel: ["early stage strangles in a horse", "listeriosis in a ram", "Pasteurella pnemonia in a bullock", "tetanus in a pig"],
				ansInfo: ["From 40 to 60% of Staph.aureus from mastitis produce &#945; lactamase and are resistant to normal doses of penicillin. The other diseases are all caused by bacteria which are usually susceptible to penicillin, although there are a variety of reasons why it may not work well."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is generally susceptible to",
				ans: "tiamulin",
				ansSel: ["penicillin", "oxytetracycline", "streptomycin", "bacitracin"],
				ansInfo: ["You will have to learn this sort of information. Bear in mind that it keeps changing as bacteria become resistant!"],
