      <h2 id="ctt">The chemotherapeutic triangle</h2>
  <p>When antimicrobial drugs are administered to an animal (the host) infected with a pathogenic micro-organism, there is a triangular interaction between the the host, the micro-organism and the antimicrobial drug. These interactions must be considered when formulating a rational protocol for antibiotic use.</p>
  <p>Host responses to antibiotics include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>no effect</li>
    <li>allergic responses</li>
    <li>tissue drug residue deposition</li>
    <li>toxicity</li>
    <li>drug interactions with other therapy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Bacterial responses to antibiotics include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>death of the micro-organism</li>
    <li>slowing or stopping of bacterial replication</li>
    <li>development of resistance</li>
    <li>super-infection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Success of antimicrobial therapy depends on achieving one of the two desirable responses while keeping undesirable effects to a minimum. Remember, the underlying principle of all drug use which was initially stated by Hippocrates (460-377 BC): <em>Primum non nocare</em>. You must balance the risk of undesirable effects against the probability of benefits.</p>
  <h2 id="sel">Drug selection process</h2>
  <p>For any antibiotic to work, the bacteria must be susceptible to the drug, and the drug must get to where the bacteria are. You should also consider the chances of clinically significant resistance developing, either in the animal(s) or environment / owner. There are also a number of other desirable factors. Follow the process below.</p>
  <p>1. <strong>Make a diagnosis</strong>. Any treatment in the absence of a diagnosis is irrational. Therefore, before selecting an antimicrobial drug as (part of) a treatment, an attempt must be made to confirm that an infection exists.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Identify the</strong> (class of) <strong>bacterium</strong> causing, or likely to be causing the infection. A sample, smear and Gram stain is useful to help with this. In the practical clinical situation, it is not always possible to sample, smear, identify and culture the causative bacterium. You may have to rely on knowledge of the incidence of bacterial disease in your practice, and on the patterns of disease caused by commonly pathogens. This allows an empirical choice of antimicrobial. (A word of warning: charts which are to be found in text books showing incidence of bacterial diseases should be used as a guide only. Major differences occur in host species and between countries.) It is best to isolate, culture and test the resistance of the infective organism to available drugs. The infective microorganism must be sensitive to the drug chosen.</p>
  <p>3. Consider <strong>pharmacokinetics</strong>. The drug must come into contact with the bacteria, ie, it must be adequately distributed to the infected tissue and it must be soluble in the milieu of the infected tissue matrix. The drug must be able to reach high enough concentrations at the site of the infection to affect the bacteria, ie, the drug must achieve a concentration greater than the MIC for the causative bacteria at the site of the infection (ideally 4 - 5 times the MIC should be achieved in the plasma). The drug must be present for sufficient length of time at the site of the infection but must not reside in tissues excessively (especially in food producing animals). To achieve all this, the correct dose and frequency must be chosen.</p>
  <p>4. Consider <strong>resistance</strong>. It is better to choose a drug for which resistance is slower or less likely to develop. A narrow spectrum drug will exert less selection pressure on non target organisms. Use drugs which are less likely to produce clinically significant resistance in the animal, owner or environment; eg, if a penicillin is likely to work as well as a cephalosporin, use the penicillin.</p>
  <p>5. Consider <strong>host factors</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Species</em>: what drugs are licensed?</li>
    <li>Is this a food producing animal? - withholding times!</li>
    <li>Are there any <em>other restrictions</em> (racing animals)?</li>
    <li>What <em>routes of administration</em> are practical and are there appropriate formulations?</li>
    <li>Is the animal <em>pregnant</em> / <em>lactating</em>?</li>
    <li><em>Age</em>: are there special toxicity or dose rate considerations?</li>
    <li><em>Body weight</em>: are there special toxicity or practical dosing considerations?</li>
    <li>Is the animal <em>adequately hydrated</em> and do the animal’s kidneys work?</li>
    <li>Is there evidence of <em>biliary obstruction</em>?</li>
    <li>Is the animal <em>immunocompetant</em>?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>6. Consider the <strong>mechanism of action</strong> of the antimicrobial drug of choice. Until recently it was thought better to choose a drug which is nominally bactericidal over one which is merely bacteriostatic. However, it is now clear that little information exists as to whether a particular antimicrobial drug is bactericidal or bacteriostatic against a particular infective organism at the concentration reached at the site of infection. It is more important to consider whether or not the drug is likely to penetrate well to the site of infection, and whether it will be active in that environment. The distinction between bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs is probably only important in immunocompromised animals.</p>
  <p>7. The probable <strong>toxic effects</strong> of the chosen drug should be considered. The frequency of immune mediated reactions to the antimicrobial drug formulation should be considered.</p>
  <p>8. <strong>Interactions</strong> between the chosen drug and any other present or potential medications should be anticipated.</p>
  <p>9 The propensity for the drug to initiate <strong>super-infections</strong> should be considered, especially in some species (eg, the horse, guinea pig).</p>
  <p>10. The ease of <strong>administration</strong>, and the pain and / or stress caused by the administration of the chosen drug should be considered. These factors are important both from client compliance and animal ethical view points. The pain caused by deep intramuscular injections of certain antibiotic preparations is probably overlooked as a major cause of continuing debilitation.</p>
  <p>11. The <strong>cost</strong> of the chosen drug should be considered.</p>
  <p>12. <strong>Supportive treatment</strong> may make a big difference to the outcome.</p>
  <p>Finally, assess the risk / benefit ratio! (but see also the guidelines below).</p>
  <p>13. <strong>Monitor</strong> the effects of the drug - reduction in fever etc - to check that your selection was suitable.</p>
  <h2 id="probs">Common problems</h2>
  <h3>Factors under control of the veterinarian:</h3>
  <p>The most common reason for misuse of antibiotics is a failure to make a diagnosis. This often derives from an invalid assumption that an elevated temperature or fever means an infection. The diagnosis fever of unknown origin is not in itself sufficient justification for administration of antimicrobial drugs.</p>
  <p>Another common error is to fail to identify the infective organism, even empirically. This leads to the frequent prescription of broad spectrum antibiotics. Broad spectrum antibiotics are more likely than those with a narrower spectrum to induce super-infection and bacterial resistance. From the legal point of view, the medical record should indicate the reason for the choice of drug. Habitual use of a broad spectrum antimicrobial drug indicates a low (and unacceptable) standard of diagnosis.</p>
  <p>Isolation of the wrong organism occurs frequently. Therefore, laboratory reports should be considered carefully, not blindly acted upon. It is necessary to reconsider the method of sampling (aerobic vs anaerobic), and the suspected agent (bacteria, mycoplasma, viruses).</p>
  <p>Inappropriate choice of antimicrobial drug is a leading cause of failure of therapy. Assuming an organism has been identified, there really is no excuse for this. Often this error occurs because of a lack of knowledge. Does the drug of choice cross the blood/brain barrier? Does it have access to the prostate? Is it excreted in an active form in the urine? etc...</p>
  <p>Inappropriate dose schedules (too little, too infrequently, not for long enough), and failure of client compliance in dosing are frequent causes for failure of antimicrobial therapy.</p>
  <p>Failure will often result from not providing adequate ancillary therapy, eg, drainage for an abscess.</p>
  <h3>Factors not (necessarily) under control of the veterinary surgeon</h3>
  <p>Bacterial resistance to the chosen antimicrobial drug occurs frequently in some clinical settings. In general, resistance patterns cannot be predicted. Bacterial resistance to the chosen antimicrobial drug can also develop during the course of therapy.
  </p>
  <p>Mixed infections can result in disease in which it is difficult to adequately identify all active bacteria.  </p>
  <p>Lack of correlation between <em>in vitro</em> tests and <em>in vivo</em> sensitivity occurs frequently. A knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pathology should allow this to be predicted in most cases.
  </p>
  <p>Occasionally, treatment has to be stopped because of side effects.  </p>
  <h2 id="sens">Antimicrobial sensitivity testing</h2>
  <p>Samples for isolation and culture of bacteria from infected tissues can be very useful in selection of appropriate drugs since different bacterial species have different patterns of antimicrobial sensitivity. However, not all resistance patterns can be predicted. Therefore, testing the sensitivity of bacterial isolates to available drugs should be carried out where practicable.
  </p>
  <p>If an organism is resistant to an antimicrobial drug <em>in vitro</em>, then it will almost certainly be resistant to the same drug <em>in vivo </em>(assuming it has been properly cultured on the correct medium). However, if an antimicrobial drug is effective <em>in vitro</em>, it is not necessarily effective <em>in vivo</em>. Hence, laboratory testing is really resistance testing and not sensitivity testing.
  </p>
  <p>The results of Kirby-Bauer sensitivity tests can be misleading. The diffusion of the drug through the culture media may be impeded or enhanced relative to other drugs, leading to altered expectations of its efficacy. The media may contain factors which allow the bacteria to avoid toxicity, e.g. para-aminobenzoic (PABA) will antagonise the effect of sulphonamide antimicrobials. Different labs use different techniques, although the American NCCLS protocols are probably commonest. MIC data is much more useful than merely R or S.
  </p>
  <p>The presence of antibiotic in samples taken from animals already treated with an antibiotic may prevent bacterial growth <em>in vitro</em>, despite their failure to do so <em>in vivo</em>. So take the samples for culture and sensitivity testing <strong>before</strong> you give the drug. If empirical therapy has been started and has failed, then all antimicrobial drugs should be withdrawn 2 to 3 days before samples are taken for culture.  </p>
  <p>From the practical point of view, it is important to request the testing for sensitivity to drugs which are available for use by the route necessary to reach the site of infection.  </p>
  <h2 id="prof">Prophylaxis</h2>
  <p>Rational use of antimicrobial drugs for prevention of infectious disease is limited to very few applications: either where there is a predictable high risk of infection which cannot be reduced in any other way, eg, immunocompromised patients, or a few sick animals in a herd which cannot be separated; or where the consequences of infection would be disastrous, eg, some orthopaedic implants.
  </p>
  <p>In small animal medicine, prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is only rational for severely immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus, those with myelogenous leukaemia, or those on immunosuppressive chemotherapy. In procedures such as catheter placement there is no justification for the use of antimicrobial drugs. Aseptic technique when placing and regular replacement of intravenous catheters should be sufficient to prevent infections. </p>
  <p>In food animal medicine, antibiotics are frequently overused to prevent infections. They are not a susbtitute for good hygiene. See guidelines below. </p>
  <p>The use of antibiotics in surgical procedures should be limited to cases where bacteraemia is likely to be produced and the animal is immunocompromised or has an implant of some sort (eg, an orthopaedic plate). <span class="warning">Antibiotics are not a substitute for aseptic technique!</span></p>
  <h2 id="gls">Guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery</h2>
  <p>Use penicillins or cephalosporins, iv if possible. They are bactericidal, achieve peak tissue levels rapidly (approximately 20 - 40 mins, so give the drug half an hour before surgery), and are relatively non toxic. The more strongly protein bound drugs in these classes (oxacillin, nafcillin) do not penetrate fibrin as well as the less strongly protein bound (ampicillin, penicillin). Use intermittent bolus dosing at half the normal dosing intervals (about every 2 hours for iv ß-lactams). This regime produces approximately 2 - 4 times higher tissue concentrations than does iv infusion. Continue therapy throughout surgery but there is no value in prophylactic treatment afterwards.</p>
  <p>Cephazolin sodium 20mg/kg iv every 2 hours gives broad spectrum cover. </p>
