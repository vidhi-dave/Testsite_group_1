  <h1> Resistance </h1>
  <p><a href="../../lectureSite/PharmLec4/22resist.pdf">Resistance lecture</a></p>
  <img src="images/resistance2col.gif">
  <p>Every time an antibiotic is given, there is pressure on the exposed bacterial population to select for resistance. There may be very few resistant bacteria present, but if most of the sensitive ones are killed, the resistant ones can grow to fill the space. Resistance is important, both from the point of view of treating the animal, and from passing resistance on to human pathogens, in either the animal&rsquo;s owner or the general public. Bacterial resistance in people is increasing, probably as a result of poor prescribing practices by GPs, but about half the antibiotics used in NZ are given to animals, so <span class="warning">responsible use of antibiotics by vets is essential</span>.</p>
  <p>Antibiotic resistance is a relative term, and describes a situation where a bacterium is not inhibited or killed by concentrations of antibiotic that would normally be lethal to that bacterium. By common usage, resistance relates to antibiotic concentrations achievable in the animal or person being treated for infection.</p>
  <p>Bacteria can be resistant because:</p>
  <p><strong>the drug does not reach its target</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>active efflux of macrolides and streptogramins
    <li>active efflux of tetracyclines
  </ul>
  <p><strong>the drug is inactivated</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>&#946;-lactamase enzymes which inactivate penicillins and cephalosporins
    <li>chloramphenicol acetyltransferase acetylates and inactivates the drug
    <li>modification of aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin
  </ul>
  <p><strong>the target is changed</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>changes to the ribosome which prevent the binding of macrolides such as tylosin and erythromycin
    <li>changes to the penicillin binding protein which stops methicillin killing some 
    <em>Staph aureus</em>
    <li>changes to the bacterial DNA gyrase, preventing the binding of quinolones
  </ul>
  <p>Depending on the specificity of the target or efflux mechanism, resistance may be to a single drug or a whole class, or classes of drug.</p>
  <p>Antibiotic resistance in bacteria may be intrinsic or acquired. Intrinsic resistance occurs when a bacterium normally does not possess the particular target structure of the antibiotic, or does not possess the sort of cell wall which allows the drug in. Examples include the resistance of Gram negative organisms to penicillin. Acquired resistance occurs when a bacterial strain that is normally susceptible becomes resistant. A single bacterial strain will often be resistant to several different antibiotics via different mechanisms of resistance. These may be acquired either in single or multiple steps.</p>
  <p>Bacteria can acquire resistance by mutation of their own DNA or, more importantly, by acquiring some DNA from another bacterium.</p>
  <h2 id="chrom">Chromosomal mutation</h2>
  <p>Mutation occurs all the time, and most mutations are of no use or detrimental to the bacterium. This type of resistance tends to develop slowly in small steps, but there are exceptions. The importance varies with different antibiotics - most important for streptomycin, erythromycin and rifampicin. This type of resistance is probably favoured by intermittent use of low doses of antibiotic.</p>
  <h2 id="trans">Transferable drug resistance</h2>
  <p>Bacteria share DNA readily, both within and across species, including non-pathogenic species. This may occur by several different processes:</p>
  <p>Conjugation is probably most important. A donor bacterium conjugates with a recipient and passes across a copy of a plasmid, which may contain resistance genes. This may occur between species, mainly in Gram negatives and enterococci. The plasmids may carry genes for resistance to a single, or many antibiotics. The composition of plasmids is continually being changed by the insertion of transposons, many of which carry antibiotic resistance genes.</p>
  <p>DNA can also be transferred by transduction, where a bacteriophage takes DNA from one bacterium and puts it into another. This seems particularly important in <em>Staph aureus</em> where plasmids carrying resistance genes for penicillins, erythromycin, tetracyclines or chloramphenicol can be transferred. It is also important in <em>Streps </em>for the transfer of genes for toxins.</p>
  <p>The simplest method, transformation, is where bacteria pick up free DNA lying around. The importance of this is unknown, but it is certainly possible in the gut. It probably only occurs with Gram positive bacteria. Sources of free DNA could include dead bacteria, either gut inhabitants or the bacteria used to produce growth promoters, which are present in the crude extracts used for this purpose. (These bacteria must, by definition, be resistant to the antibiotic they produce.) Less importantly (?), many transgenic crops used for animal feed (soya beans and maize) contain antibiotic resistance marker genes.</p>
  <p>Resistance is usually only measured in pathogens, but commensals can act as a reservoir of resistance genes. The importance of this is unknown but is likely to be large. Giving antibiotics selects for resistance among commensals too! This has been highlighted by the development of multi resistant bacteria such as enterococci, which, although not normally regarded as pathogenic, can kill severely immunocompromised patients in intensive care units in hospitals.</p>
  <h2 id="redRes">Reducing resistance</h2>
  <p>Control of resistance depends on responsible use (see later), but is mainly a matter of common sense and only using antibiotics where absolutely necessary. Relying on new drugs coming along is not an option - bacteria move much faster than the drug companies or regulators. Most human hospitals have a policy of reserving some antibiotics (eg, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides and modern cephalosporins) for life threatening diseases, to prevent the development of resistance to them.</p>
  <h3>Reducing resistance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Choose a drug on resistance testing, where practicable.
          <li> Use narrow spectrum antimicrobials whenever possible.
          <li> Use the full effective dose for as short a period as possible.
          <li> Isolate the patient (and wash your hands / gumboots!).
          <li> Use antibacterials not prone to producing resistance.
          <li> Restrict the prophylactic use of antimicrobials to high risk patients only.
          <li> In chronic care patients, regularly (but not frequently) change antimicrobial drugs.
          <li> With aminoglycosides, use the longest effective dosage interval.

  <h2 id="people">Problem bacteria in people</h2>
  <p>There are several areas of concern about resistance in human medicine, many of which are relevant to us. Increasingly, plasmids or other transmissible bits of DNA encoding resistance, eg the NDM1 imipenem resistance gene, are at least as important as species of bacteria since movement between species seems to be common. The situation in NZ is not as bad as the UK or USA where there are several species of major concern: <em>Enterococcus faecium</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Enterobacter</em> species.</p>
  <h3>Coliforms and Campylobacter</h3>
  <p>Food poisoning caused by resistant Gram negative bacteria (<em>E coli</em> O157, <em>Salmonella </em>Typhimurium, especially DT104, and <em>Campylobacter </em>spp.) are probably zoonoses in some / many cases and are common overseas. In the UK, 4.7% of cattle and 1.7% of sheep carry <em>E. coli</em> O157 (no figures for NZ, but almost certainly not as high as the UK). Antibiotic resistant campylobacter are common in NZ, most of the others are probably rare imports. Extended spectrum &#946; lactamase (ESBL) producing <em>E. coli</em> (ie, resistant to cephalosporins) are starting to cause concern here.</p>
  <h3>Staphs and other cocci</h3>
  <p>Gram positive pathogens, particularly methicillin resistant <em>Staph. aureus</em> (<a href="abMRSA.html">MRSA</a>) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), can be virtually untreatable. It is possible that resistant enterococci from animals pass on resistance genes to human enterococci which pass them on to MRSA. This has been shown <em>in vitro</em>, but not (yet) <em>in vivo</em>. Vancomycin intermediate <em>Staph aureus</em> (VISA) is becoming a problem in Japan and Europe. It is very bad news. Low level MRSA is fairly common in Pacific Islanders, but high level MRSA (epidemic MRSA type 15 (EMRSA-15)) is also increasing in NZ, comprising 7% of <em>Staph. aureus</em> isolates in 2001 (up from 4% in 2000) (cf UK - almost 50% in 2001). This particularly nasty bug has been traced back to a patient with eczema in Guildford (near London) in 1960. It has since spread around the world, mutating as it goes and acquiring extra resistance genes. There are no figures for NZ, but MRSA kills 5,000 people a year in the UK, and is involved in the deaths of 15,000 more.</p>
  <p>Drugs used for <em>Staph aureus</em> in people:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>penicillin - practically useless now because of resistance (&#x03B2; lactamases)
    <li>flucloxacillin - related to methicillin and so no use against MRSA
    <li>rifampicin - resistance develops quickly and is usually reserved for TB
    <li>vancomycin - main MRSA drug
    <li>linezolid - second line MRSA drug
    <li>quinupristin &amp; dalfopristin combination - not yet approved for use in NZ, drug of last resort for named patients in hospitals
  </ul>
  <p>Vancomycin intermediate <em>Staph aureus</em> (VISA) has been around in Japan and the USA for several years, but in July 2002, the first fully vancomycin resistant <em>Staph aureus </em>was reported from the USA. Luckily for the patient, it was not resistant to chloramphenicol.</p>
  <p>VRE was isolated from five people in NZ in 2001; one patient and four carriers. The patient died. There were 10 reports in 2002, but no details yet. It has also been isolated from chickens in Otago (it has not been looked for anywhere else in the country). The human strains are different from the poultry strains.</p>
  <h3>Acinetobacter</h3>
  <p><em>Acinetobacter</em> used to be a commensal found in hot, dry countries. It has recently become established in hospitals in temperate climates. The current theory is that it was brought in in contaminated wounds in soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it has not been studied much in animals. Some strains are resistant to <strong>all</strong> known antibiotics. Anecdotal reports say that a large proportion of hospital-acquired infections in the USA are multiresistant <em>Acinetobacter</em>.</p>
  <h3>Klebsiella and Pseudomonas</h3>
  <p>Both are ubiquitous in nature and opportunistic pathogens. They have a large variety of mechanisms to cope with host immunity and antibiotics. They are relatively common in nosocomial infections. Both also cause problems in animals.</p>
  <h3>Others</h3>
  <p>Multiple drug resistant <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em> is a big problem in developing countries, but does not receive much attention elsewhere. Resistance probably arises from inappropriate human treatment, but can spread indirectly from animals.</p>
  <p>Drug resistance in pneumococci and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> is also a problem, but no way has been found for blaming this on the veterinary profession yet. However, some of the drugs used for TB in people can also be used for other things in animals: they should be avoided or used with extreme care. They may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>rifampicin - sometimes used in animals
    <li>clarithromycin / azithromycin - sometimes used in animals
    <li>ethambutol, isoniazid and pyrazinamide - not used in animals
    <li>streptomycin (only used as a last resort) - commonly misused in animals
    <li>New generation fluoroquinolones and linezolid have been used and may become more popular.
  </ul>
  <p>Multidrug resistant TB is still rare in NZ (less than 1% of new cases), but is killing huge numbers of people overseas. A new form, extensive multidrug resistant TB (XDR), emerged in S.Africa a few years ago and is spreading merrily around the world (particularly Russia), although it has not reached NZ yet. It is practically untreatable.</p>
  <p>The WHO calculates that 30% of the world population carries TB, so this is likely to become a more important issue in the future.</p>
  <h2 id="animals">Problem bacteria in animals</h2>
  <p><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is generally regarded as an environmental organism which is an opportunistic pathogen of animals and people. It has a much larger genome than other bacteria, which means that it has lots of redundant systems it can use if one is knocked out by an antibiotic (eg, it has 12 drug efflux pump systems). In practical terms, resistance will develop rapidly, often over the course of treatment. Non-antibiotic treatments are best where possible - for instance, it does not like acid conditions and dilute vinegar can often stop it growing in dogs&rsquo; ears. Transfer of antibiotic resistant <em>Pseudomonas </em>from animals to people has not yet been shown, but is a real possibility.</p>
  <p><em>Pseudomonas </em>(and some other bacteria) can sense when there are others around, and when a quorum forms, they cooperate to produce a slimy biofilm which is resistant to most chemicals. This can be very bad news, and cannot be prevented at present.</p>
  <h2 id="d+c">Food for thought?</h2>
  <p>Although tranfer of resistance from animals to people is usually blamed on the use of growth promoters in food animals, no one has looked closely at companion animals. There is one reported case of multiresistant <em>Salmonella </em>Typhimurium transfer from a dog to its owner, but it probably occurs commonly. Development of resistant bacteria after treatment is relatively common in dogs and cats, and most owners do not practise any sort of infection control. Beware!</p>
  <h2 id="NZ">Situation in NZ</h2>
  <p>Antibiotic resistance in bacteria important in animals is not recorded in any systematic way, although this is starting to change as ESR collate records from people and animals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that we do not have the large scale problems seen overseas (14,000 people/year die in the USA from multiple drug resistant infections). Let&rsquo;s keep NZ free of them.</p>
  <p>The law is in the process of changing to make it more difficult for vets to use valuable antibiotics indiscriminately (see law notes).</p>
  <h2 id="antivir">Antivirals and antifungals</h2>
  <p>Resistance to these can occur as well, and is starting to emerge as a problem in people.</p>
