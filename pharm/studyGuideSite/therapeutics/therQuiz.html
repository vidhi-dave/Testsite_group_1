				ques: "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the horse may be prevented using:",
				ans: "sodium cromoglycate",
				ansSel: ["acetylcholine analogues", "histamine", "adrenaline", "penicillin","corticosteroids", "atropine", "strangles vaccine", "Hobday's operation"],
				ansInfo: ["The aetiology of COPD is complex, but many cases are improved by bronchodilators. Adrenaline is too short acting to be any use, as well as having major side effects on the heart. Sodium cromoglycate is used for prevention. Acetylcholine and histamine will cause bronchoconstriction. Bacteria are not involved so penicillin and streptomycin do not work. Strangles is a different disease - and the vaccine is of dubious efficacy, and Hobday's operation has been shown to have no effect."],
			},
			{
				ques: "You have been treating an 8yr old mongrel with NSAIDs for severe hip arthritis for 3 wks. The dog initially improved but is now anorexic, depressed and unwilling to move. Endoscopy reveals gastric ulceration. The best course of action is:",
				ans: "continue NSAIDs but add misoprostol",
				ansSel: ["continue NSAIDs as it is more important to treat pain than the ulcers", "stop the NSAIDs", "prescribe morphine tablets instead of the NSAIDs", "continue NSAIDs but feed the dog a bland diet","change to a different NSAID", "bilateral hip replacement", "continue NSAIDs but add sucralfate","stop the NSAIDs and use green lipped mussel extract instead","prescribe a benzodiazepine to stimulate the dog's appetite"],
				ansInfo: ["The ulcers are probably caused by the NSAIDs, so either another analgesic must be given or an antiulcer drug must be added to the NSAID treatment. Sucralfate is not a good choice though, as it inhibits the absorption of most drugs. Morphine may be effective, but it is not a good idea to prescribe drugs of abuse unless there is absolutely no alternative. Green lipped mussel extract is very unlikely to be potent enough to treat sever arthritis alone."],
			},
			{
				ques: "You are presented with a one year old female Labrador which is staining frequently to pass urine and showing obvious signs of discomfort. The dog has been seen at the practice since birth and has never had any health problems. The best treatment is",
				ans: "seven day course of co-amoxiclav",
				ansSel: ["grapefruit juice", "take a cystocentesis sample for culture and sensitivity, and treat appropriately when the results come back", "do nothing, as cystitis is usually self limiting in bitches", "a single large dose of enrofloxacin", "give 1L of saline iv", "feed the dog dry food to encourage it to drink more", "give diazepam to relax the bladder", "pass a urinary catheter and flush the bladder with dilute formalin"],
				ansInfo: ["E. coli is the commonest causative organism of cystitis in bitches, with Staphs, Streps and a variety of Gram - organisms less commonly involved. Co-amoxiclav is likely to be effective in almost all uncomplicated cases, and a culture is not required for a first presentation. Enrofloxacin is also likely to be effective, but should be reserved for cases where nothing else is likely to work, to reduce the development of resistance. Dilute formalin flush would prevent resistance but is extremely irritant. Doing nothing is not an option, as the animal's welfare would be compromised. Cranberry juice may have some effect in women, but not grapefruit juice. Flushing the bladder out by increasing urine flow by various means is used in women but has only a very small effect. Diazepam does not relax the bladder. "],
			},
			{
				ques: "You are presented with a three year old male cat which was involved in a fight several days ago and now has a soft, fluctuant swelling at the base of its tail which you suspect is an abscess. Its temperature is 38.5&#176;C The best treatment is:",
				ans: "lance the abscess under ketamine anaesthesia and give a single injection of procaine penicillin",
				ansSel: ["a five day course of co-amoxyclav", "leave it alone as the abscess will eventually burst and drain", "get a nurse to hold the cat and lance the abscess", "lance the abscess under ketamine anaesthesia", "a single large dose of azithromycin", "lance the abscess under epidural analgesia", "get the owner to apply warm poultices to the abscess until it bursts", "a single injection of cefovecin"],
				ansInfo: ["Where there is pus, it must be let out. Antibiotics alone will not work. Since lancing the abscess is likely to be painful, an anaesthetic or analgesic should be used: just holding the cat is likely to lead to injuries all round. Epidurals are contraindicated where there is a chance of introducing infection around the cord."],
			},
			{
				ques: "A dog is given an anaesthetic premed containing buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist, to prevent pain during the operation. It receives fentanyl, a full opioid agonist during the op, followed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist (to counteract the respiratory depressant side effects of the opioids). How would you control the dog&#39;s pain with opioids post op?",
				ans: "give a high dose fentanyl infusion iv",
				ansSel: ["give more buprenorphine iv", "give a bolus of fentanyl iv", "use a different agonist such as morphine", "sedate the dog with ACP", "use atracurium and morphine", "use medetomidine and buprenorphine", "use a &#954; partial agonist such as butorphanol", "use ketamine and morphine"],
				ansInfo: ["Buprenorphine is a partially irreversible partial agonist: it takes about 45 minutes to bind to the receptors and the same to dissociate. Its peak effect is less than a full agonist. Fentanyl is a full agonist, but is too short acting to be much use for post op pain if given by a bolus. Any other full agonist still has the problem of the receptors being occupied by some of the other drugs given. Adding &#945;2 agonists or NMDA antagonists may help a bit but is unreliable. Placing a local block is a sensible choice and should be done anyway. The object of the exercise is to relive the dog's pain, not prevent it showing the signs of pain, so a sedative, or worse, a muscle realaxant, is contra-indicated (and would probably not work anyway)."],
			},
			{
				ques: "A bitch which was spayed this morning has not recovered from anaesthesia, has very pale mucous membranes and seems to be going into shock. You diagnose a slipped ovarian ligature and intra-abdominal bleeding. The best treatment while you organise to take her back to surgery is",
				ans: "blood with citrate phosphate dextrose which has been in the fridge for 1 day",
				ansSel: ["wait and see what happens", "gelatin solution", "0.9% saline solution", "heparin to prevent DIC", "hypertonic saline", "dextran 40","tranexamic acid", "vitamin K1 injection"],
				ansInfo: ["Any fluid which supplies volume can be used in acute haemorrhage, but if the bleeding is severe, red cells, platelets and clotting factors are needed. Colloids are better than crystalloids, since they stay in the circulation longer, although dextran 40 prevents blood clotting. Heparin is an anticoagulant and is likely to make the bleeding worse. Tranexamic acid and vitamin K will have no effect in this situation."],
			},
			{
				ques: "You need to sedate a dog which has been in a road traffic accident for X rays. The dog has a fractured femur, a suspected fractured pelvis and is going into shock. The best course of action is to",
				ans: "give it a big dose of morphine, treat the shock then X ray it",
				ansSel: ["wait and see what happens", "treat the shock, immobilise the fractures and forget about the X rays", "give it acepromazine, X ray it quickly, then decide what to do", "euthanise the dog", "give a general anaesthetic for X rays followed by surgery", "just hold it down for X rays, then decide what to do", "give a small dose of muscle relaxant and X ray it quickly", "use medetomidine"],
				ansInfo: ["The dog will be in pain, which is likely to cause excitement, particularly when the dog is moved, so an analgesic is indicated as well as fracture immobilisation. The dog should be treated for shock, and drugs such as acepromazine which cause vasodilatation should be avoided. Euthanasia is a last resort, doing nothing is not an ethical option. General anaesthesia should be avoided until the shock has been sorted out."],
			},
			{
				ques: "The best treatment for mild diarrhoea in calves is",
				ans: "oral fluids",
				ansSel: ["a mixture of sulphonamides and aminoglycoside antibiotics", "codeine per rectum", "a 3rd generation cephalosporin antibiotic", "metaclopramide", "a mixture of sulphonamides and aminoglycoside antibiotics, with kaolin, pectin and potassium ions with a pink dye", "watered down milk with enrofloxacin", "a sngle injection of spectinomycin", "nothing by mouth for three days"],
				ansInfo: ["Oral fluids are the best treatment for mild diarrhoea in any species. They are only contraindicated if the animal is also vomiting. Antibiotics should not be used unless there is systemic illness. Animals with diarrhoea should not be deprived of fluids."],
			},
			{
				ques: "A farmer consults you in November about his high cell count. Last year you treated several cases of Staph aureus mastitis in the herd, but this year he changed vets and bought a load of cheap benzylpenicillin tubes for his clinical cases. The best course of action is",
				ans: "organise a herd test, sample any clinical cases for culture and sensitivity, then sell him appropriate antibiotics and give him general advice",
				ansSel: ["tell him to go and talk to the other vet", "sell him 3G cephalosporin tubes since they will kill all likely pathogens", "assume he still has Staph aureus and sell him cloxacillin tubes", "tell him to double the dose of penicillin", "request a herd test and cull all cows above the grade cut off", "request a herd test and dry off all cows above the grade cut off", "just sell him your box of tubes with the shortest expiry date since he is not your client", "sell him a box of oxytetracycline tubes since they are broad spectrum and cheap"],
				ansInfo: ["There are many possible causes of high cell counts, but chronic Staph. aureus infection is high on the list of possibilities. This should be confirmed by culture and sensitivity testing. The best empirical choice of antibiotic is cloxacillin, but you can only prescribe it to animals under your care. A herd test should be carried out, but only the cows with extremely high counts need be culled. You should also ring the other vet to check what he has done this season and let him know that the cows are now under your care."],
			},
			{
				ques: "You are called to suture a cut on a pony's leg which happened 30 minutes ago. The cut just penetrates the skin and is not contaminated. The best course of action is",
				ans: "give detomidine iv for sedation, mepivacaine infiltration for analgesia, flush with sterile saline and suture",
				ansSel: ["give detomidine iv for sedation, lignocaine infiltration for analgesia, flush with sterile saline and suture", "give detomidine iv for sedation, lignocaine infiltration for analgesia, suture and give procaine penicillin im", "give acepromazine iv for sedation, lignocaine infiltration for analgesia, flush with sterile saline, suture and give procaine penicillin iv", "give xylazine iv for sedation, suture and give procaine penicillin im", "give procaine penicillin and bandage the leg", "suture under xylazine/ketamine anaesthesia, then give tetanus antitoxin", "sell the owner some emu oil ointment to rub into the wound", "give detomidine iv for sedation, lignocaine infiltration for analgesia, flush with iodine solution and suture"],
				ansInfo: ["The pony is likely to need sedation; an &#945;2 agonist iv is probably best. This will not provide enough analgesia, so a local block is usually used. Mepivacaine is less likely to cause an irritant reaction than lignocaine. A clean, shallow cut just needs to be flushed with sterile saline and sutured. No antibiotic or tetanus antitoxin is necessary unless the wound is contaminated. Procaine penicillin should never be given iv."],
