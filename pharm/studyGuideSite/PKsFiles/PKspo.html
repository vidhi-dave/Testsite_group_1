<p class="titleSG">oral (po) administration</p>
<p><br>
The surface area of gut available for absorption of the drug is the most important
  factor effecting the rate of absorption. Disease processes such as gastroenteritis,
  neoplastic infiltration or villus atrophy may significantly change the available
  absorptive surface area. This should be taken into account before the administration
  of an oral medication.<br>
Dilution of the drug by administration with feed or with fluid would retard the
rate of drug absorption since the drug diffuses down a concentration gradient.
Some foods contain substances which bind to the drug, preventing absorption.</p>
<p>The
  concentration gradient is the main factor affecting the rate of drug absorption
  (rather than purely the drug concentration in the gut). Therefore, the drug
  concentration in the blood or extravascular fluid is also an important determinant
  of the rate
  of drug absorption. Factors which affect the drug concentration in the blood
  or extravascular fluid include the rate of distribution and the rate of elimination
  of the drug. More importantly, in the local environment of the absorptive process,
  the rate of blood flow and / or lymph flow determines to a large extent the
  steepness of the concentration gradient. Blood flow and lymph flow are dependent
  upon the
  timing of the drug administration with respect to meals, exercise and other
variants of cardiac output.</p>
<p>Drug absorption can also be altered by alterations
    in the permeability of the gut wall. Diseases such as infiltrative neoplasia,
    inflammatory bowel disease
    and mucosal injuries by viruses, bacteria, parasites and caustic chemicals
    can all increase the rate of absorption of drugs. In addition increases in
    the permeability
    of the gut wall can result in the absorption of drugs not normally absorbed
    from the gut. Obviously, if the animal vomits its medication up, the drug
  will not
    be absorbed. Gastroenteritis usually results in a faster than normal passage
    of gut contents, the drug may not be there long enough to be fully absorbed.
    Therefore care needs to be taken in consideration of administration of all
    drugs to animals with gastrointestinal disease.<br>
