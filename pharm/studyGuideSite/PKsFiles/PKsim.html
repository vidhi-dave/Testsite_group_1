<p class="titleSG">intramuscular (im) administration</p>
<p><br>
Surface area can be altered by injecting a given dose in aliquots to multiple
  sites, thus increasing the rate of absorption. The concentration of drug in
  the injection will also determine the steepness of the diffusion gradient for
  drug absorption. The concentration of the drug
in the injection might be altered after injection due to a formulation which
is not isosmolar. Drug concentration in the tissue fluid will also effect the
diffusion gradient. Both the rates of lymph and blood flow vary from muscle to
muscle and also vary dependent upon on exercise, cardiac output and catacholamine
release.</p>
<p>The pH in the muscle may vary from one muscle to another as a function
  of exercise and tissue perfusion. Therefore difference in the rate of absorption
  of an intramuscular
  injection will vary dependent upon the formulation used and the injection site.
  The cranial third of the neck is the preferred site in food animals (both for
  better absorption and reduced residues in edible meat), the <a href="PKsimDog.html">quadriceps</a> or deltoid
  muscles in small animals (although im injections are not often used in small
  animals because they are painful).<br>
  There are only a few examples where the permeability of blood vessels in the
  area of an injection might significantly alter the expected rate of drug absorption.
  In particular, it is important to ensure that an injection is not made into
  an inflamed area where blood vessel permeability might be expected to have
  changed.
  The proximity of the injection to impermeable boundaries such as fascial plains
  and fat is an important determinant of the rate of drug absorption after intramuscular
  administration and is to some extent controllable by appropriate choice of
injection site.</p>
<p>If an &quot;intramuscular&quot; injection actually goes into
  fat (easy with pigs) or between fascial planes (easy with cats), absorption
  will be variable but probably
  much slower than expected. If it goes into a vein, absorption will be much
  faster than expected, resulting in a relative overdose of organs with a high
  blood flow,
  and probably side effects.<br>
