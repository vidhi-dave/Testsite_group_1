<div id="text"><h1>Mathematical models</h1>
<p>It is useful to be able to predict what a drug will do before you give it
  to an animal. If you have a computer with suitable software and are that way
  inclined you can have hours of fun fitting curves and deriving equations for
  plasma concentration / time curves of drugs which may help you to do this.
  There are a few clinically important concepts, however, which allow prediction
  of how long a drug is likely to stay in the plasma and thus how long it is
likely to act.</p>
<p>There are several different ways of doing this, all of which
  can be taken to absurd levels of complexity. In stochastic models, drug molecules
  are assumed
  to move randomly as each is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and eliminated.
  Each molecule hangs around in the body for a finite length of time, thus the
  mean residence time (MRT) gives an idea of the time course of absorbtion and
  elimination. This approach requires few assumptions but the MRT is of limited
usefulness.</p>
<p>Another approach is compartmental modelling. This requires more
  assumptions to be made, but if the assumptions are correct, the data is more
  useful. In
  the simplest model the animal consists of a single (purely theoretical) compartment
  in which drugs are quickly and evenly mixed. The volume of this compartment
  is the volume of distribution of the drug (Vd). The concentration of drug will
  fall as it is eliminated by metabolism and excretion. With most drugs, rate
  of elimination is directly proportional to concentration (first
  order kinetics).
  Some drugs rely on a saturable metabolic or excretion system; once this is
  saturated, adding more drug will make no difference, the system proceeds as
  fast as it can which is a fixed rate (zero order kinetics). Not many veterinary
  drugs do this at normal doses, phenlybutazone in the horse at some dose rates,
paracetamol in the cat and phenytoin in the dog are the only obvious examples.</p>

  <p class="caption">Left: plasma concentration / time curve, linear scale; Right:
    plasma concentration / time curve, semilogrithmic scale. The slope of the line
    in
    the right graph is the elimination rate constant. The time taken for the concentration
    to fall to half its original level is the half life (t1/2).</p>
<p>When
  a drug exhibits first order kinetics, its plasma concentration will decay exponentially.
  If a graph of plasma concentration is plotted on a logarithmic
  scale against time, the decay shows a straight line. The slope of the line
  is the elimination rate constant (kel). A more useful concept than kel is the
  half life (t1/2) which is inversely related to the elimination rate constant:
t1/2 = ln 2 / kel, or, t1/2 = 0.693 / kel</p>
<p>The half life is the time taken for
  the drug concentration to be reduced to half the original concentration. This
  gives some idea of how long the drug
  remains in the plasma and thus its duration of action. (Drugs eliminated by
zero order processes do not have fixed half lives.) Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>after	1 half life
    50% of drug remains,<br>
    after	2	25%<br>
    3	12.5%<br>
    4	6.25%<br>
    5	3.125%<br>
    6	1.56%<br>
  10	0.098%, ie 99.9% has been eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For practical purposes in clinical
  veterinary practice, a rule of thumb is that 5 half lives must pass before
  effectively all of the drug is eliminated
  (but this may not be enough to avoid residues, see below).</p>
<img src="images/repeat-dose-col.gif">
<p class="caption">Concentration time curves for repeat dosing (wavy line) or
  infusion (mean). A steady state is reached after about five half lives no matter
what the dose.</p>
<p>Similarly, five half lives must pass before a change in dose results in a new steady state
plasma concentration</a>.
It can be seen therefore that the time one must wait before attaining a new therapeutic
plasma concentration or before attaining complete elimination of a drug is a
function solely of the half life of that drug. The dose rate and the dose interval
do not effect the length of time necessary to wait for attaining a new steady
state plasma concentration or complete elimination.</p>
<h2>Two compartment models</h2>
<p>Many drugs&#8217; concentration/time curves are fitted
  to a two compartment model. Again, these compartments are purely theoretical,
  although they are sometimes
called the central and peripheral compartments. In a two compartment model, the &#8220;curve&#8221; is
fitted to two straight lines, corresponding to distribution from one compartment
to the other, and elimination from the second compartment. These straight lines
have slopes of a and b, and intercepts in the Y axis of A and B. These values
are used in equations predicting plasma concentrations at any given time. The
two lines each have a different half life, the distribution half life (t1/2a)
and the elimination half life (t1/2b).</p>

of most drugs in the body.</p>
<h3>A word of caution</h3>
<p>Multiple compartment models are possible. The body is obviously
    not a single homoeogeneous compartment: the line produced by a semilogarithmic
    plasma concentration
    / time plot is usually a curve and can be fitted by a series of straight
  lines representing different compartments. It is important to keep a sense
  of reality:
    this curve is a series of points with a line interpolated, even the points
        are an average of several animals or several experiments in one animal
        (and may be
    of dubious accuracy depending on the measurement method used).</p>

<p class="caption">Left: Plasma concentration of medetomidine in sheep after
  iv injection of 25&micro;g/kg at time 0. n = 12, mean &plusmn; sem. Right:
The same data fitted to a two compartment model.</p>
    <p>The graph   is a typical plasma concentration time curve obtained experimentally. It is
        obvious that a number of different curves could be fitted to these data.
        In this case, the computer decided that a two compartment model gave the best fit, and
the parameters were worked out on that basis.</p>
<p>If the object of a knowledge of
    pharmacokinetics is to predict what is going to happen in another animal,
  all the (large) variables must also be taken
into account. Clinical pharmacology is still an art rather than a science.</p>
