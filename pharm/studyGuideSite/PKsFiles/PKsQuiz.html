			{
				ques: "The speed of onset of clinical effects of an antibiotic may depend on",
				ans: "the route of administration",
				ansSel: ["its rate of renal clearance", "the area under the plasma concentration / time curve", "the virus being targetted", "the time of year"],
				ansInfo: ["Most drugs must be absorbed to act; the route of administration will affect the rate of absorption and thus the onset of effect. Renal excretion and area under the plasma - concentration - time curve are irrelevant. Currently used antibiotics target bacteria rather than viruses. Time of year may affect the chance of the animal getting a disease, but is unlikely to affect the rate of onset of action."],
			},
			{
				ques: "The ability of a drug to cross cell membranes depends on",
				ans: "its lipid solubility",
				ansSel: ["the route of administration", "the degree to which it is ionised at pH6", "its potency","the affinity of the drug for its receptors"],
				ansInfo: ["The lipid solubility at plasma pH (usually around 7.4) is the most important factor."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Speed of absorption of a drug after oral administration depends on",
				ans: "stomach contents",
				ansSel: ["intestinal parasite burden", "splanchnic blood flow", "plasma protein concentration", "liver function"],
				ansInfo: ["Drugs can bind to stomach contents and be absorbed more slowly. There are never enough parasites in the gut to have a major direct influence on drug absorption."],
			},
			{
				ques: "The apparent volume of distribution of a drug is",
				ans: "the volume required to contain the the drug at the same concentration as plasma",
				ansSel: ["approximately the volume of total body water minus the volume of drug injected", "equivalent to the plasma volume", "a theoretical concept of little clinical relevance", "the Vdss minus AUMC"],
				ansInfo: ["The volume of distribution is the volume of fluid required to contain the total amount of drug at the same concentration as in the plasma. This may be the same as the plasma volume but is not usually. It is of clinical relevance when working out a suitable dose of a toxic drug where overdose is to be avoided."],
			},
			{
				ques: "The elimination half life of a drug",
				ans: "varies inversely with the clearance",
				ansSel: ["is inversely related to the volume of distribution", "varies with the bioavailability", "is the time taken to reach a steady state plasma concentration", "is 0.7/kel for drugs eliminated by a zero order process"],
				ansInfo: ["The elimination half life is not related to the volume of distribution or the bioavailability (unless this is zero). A drug with a high clearance, ie, one which is removed fast, will have a short half life. The time to steady state plasma concentrations is about 5 half lives. Drugs with zero order elimination effectively have a constantly variable half life."],
			},
			{
				ques: "For a drug injected intravenously, if the plot of the log plasma concentration against time can be separated into two linear components of decay",
				ans: "the distribution phase has 1st order kinetics",
				ansSel: ["the initial phase is the absorption phase", "the existence of a 3 compartment model is suggested", "the 2nd phase indicates a zero order elimination phase", "the elimination rate constant is the Y intercept of the 2nd phase"],
				ansInfo: ["The absorption phase is the length of time taken to give the injection and is usually regarded as being instantaneous. Compartmental models only exist in computers, not animals. If both components are linear on a semilogarithmic plot, both must be first rather than zero order. The slope rather than the Y intercept gives the kel."],
			},
			{
				ques: "In drug metabolism",
				ans: "phase 1 reactions are usually performed by liver mixed function oxidases",
				ansSel: ["phase 2 reactions generally make drugs more lipid soluble", "the metabolite is always less active than the parent drug", "liver enzymes may be induced by drugs such as ketoconazole", "the liver is the only organ involved in biotransformation"],
				ansInfo: ["Phase one reactions usually involve the liver mixed function oxidases attaching a reactive group to the drug; which is then conjugated with another molecule to make the metabolite more water soluble so thet it is easier for the kidney to handle. Prodrugs have to be metabolised to be active. A variety of drugs induce production of P450 enzymes, phenobarbitone is one of the most potent. Most organs can play some role in metabolism of some drugs."],
			},
			{
				ques: "In general, drugs which are highly lipid soluble",
				ans: "have high apparent volumes of distribution",
				ansSel: ["have low oil:water partition coefficients", "are not readily absorbed after oral administration", "are readily excreted without being metabolised", "have very short elimination half lives"],
				ansInfo: ["The oil : water partition coefficient is the ratio of the proportions of drug which dissolve in oil and water when in contact with both (usually involves putting the drug in a bottle with a bit of olive oil and a bit of water and shaking).Fat soluble drugs dissolve in the oil and have a high oil : water coefficient. They usually have high volumes of distribution because they are preferentially dissolved in body fat. The fat usually forms a depot, out of which the drug leaches slowly, prolonging elimination. Fat soluble drugs are easily absorbed: water soluble drugs are easily excreted."],
			},
			{
				ques: "The blood brain barrier is easily crossed by",
				ans: "inhalation anaesthetics",
				ansSel: ["quaternary ammonium compounds", "small polar molecules", "proteins", "macrocyclic lactones"],
				ansInfo: ["Lipid soluble drugs such as general anaesthetics cross the blood brain barrier easily (they would not cause anaesthesia if they did not). Highly charged molecules such as quaternary ammonium compounds and small polar molecules, and large molecules such as proteins do not cross easily."],
			},
			{
				ques: "You give morphine sc to a dog which has a fractured leg after being hit by a car. After administration, you realise that the dog is in shock and the morphine is likely to be absorbed very slowly, if at all. The best course of action is to",
				ans: "give a small dose of fentanyl iv",
				ansSel: ["wait and see what happens", "use a NSAID for analgesia instead", "attempt to aspirate the morphine and give another dose iv", "just give another dose iv"],
				ansInfo: ["It is best to give a small dose of fentanyl iv since this is short acting and can just about be titrated to effect. Leaving the animal in pain is not on, NSAIDs are contra-indicated in shock and morphine should not normally be given iv because of side effects."],
