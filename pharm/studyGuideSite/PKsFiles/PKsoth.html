<p class="titleSG">Other Routes of Administration</p>
<p><strong><a href="PKsPatch.html">Transdermal patches</a></strong> containing drugs can be applied to hairless skin. The drug is absorbed either by simple diffusion (which is slow), by solvent carrier assisted diffusion (which can be faster) or by voltage assisted diffusion. Transdermal patches containing <a href="../CNSfiles/CNSopDr.html">fentanyl</a> have potential for the administration of analgesia to animals both for chronic pain and for acute pain post-operatively. They are often used in people and have been used clinically in dogs, horses and pigs. There are species differences in absorption, but they usually take 24 hours to reach analgesic concentrations in the brain, which limits their usefulness as it means that vets have to plan ahead.</p>
<p>Other <strong>topically</strong> administered drugs may be absorbed transdermally
    also. Sometimes this absorption is by design and sometimes an accident, resulting
    usually from
  a breakdown of the cutaneous barrier. Breakdowns of the cutaneous barrier occur
  with disease processes such as inflammation and where wounds exist. Drugs used
  in this way include nitroglycerine (see cardiovascular notes) and many anthelmintics
  for large animals. Care is necessary as in some circumstances the skin can
  act as a reservoir of drug. It is worth bearing in mind that any drug designed
  to
  cross an animal's skin will also cross human skin.</p>
<p>Drugs applied <a href="PKsEyeCat.html">topically to
    the eye</a> or <strong>subconjunctivally</strong> in the treatment of ocular disease are frequently
    absorbed systemically. There have been cases
    of iatrogenic
    Cushing's syndrome being caused by steroid administration in topical preparations
    to the eye of the dog.</p>
<p>The administration of drugs by <strong>rectal</strong> suppository is
    not often used in veterinary medicine. Very little work has been done studying
    the pharmacokinetics of
      rectal suppositories in domestic animals. However, this route of administration
      may
      be appropriate for administering drugs to animals with upper gastrointestinal
      disease or with protracted vomiting. <br>
  In large animal practice drugs are sometimes administered in pessary form
      into the lumen of the uterus. Many drugs administered in this fashion are
      absorbed
      systemically - may be important with respect to drug withholding times
      for slaughter.</p>
<p>Some soluble drugs can be applied by nebulisation and <strong>inhalation</strong>  of the resulting aerosol. These drugs are used mainly for local treatment
  of respiratory
        tract
        disease. Doses need to be calculated carefully because systemic absorption
        does occur through the mucosa. Drug classes which can be applied in this
        fashion include
        mucolytics, antibiotics and &#946; adrenergic agonists.</p>
<p><a href="../CNSfiles/CNSgAinhAn.html"><strong>Volatile anaesthetics</strong></a> are administered by inhalation and absorbed very rapidly across the alveolar membranes.</p>
<p>Drugs applied to the <strong>nasal</strong> mucosa can be
    rapidly absorbed. This route is undergoing investigation in people for the
    administration of peptides,
            which would be
            broken down in the gut if given orally. Many new drugs are peptides,
            so
            this route may
            become more important in future.</p>
<p>The <strong>intraperitoneal</strong> route is sometimes used, particularly in laboratory animals
  and lambs. Do not give drugs by this route unless there is no alternative.</p>
