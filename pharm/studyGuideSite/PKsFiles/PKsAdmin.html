</ul>
<h2>Effects of route of administration on absorption</h2>
<p>As a very rough rule, iv injection has a peak plasma concentration in seconds,
im in 15 mins, sc / po in 30 mins - 1hour. This will depend on many factors.
Peak effect will usually occur several minutes after peak plasma concentration,
depending on the drug.<br />
Since it is usually desirable for drugs to be present at their site of action
for a specified period, it is either necessary to repeat the dose often or give
a large dose in such a way that the absorption is slow and the drug is being
continuously released into the plasma. This can be done by using different routes
of administration, by altering the formulation of the drug or by using a device
which releases the drug slowly.</p>
<h2 id="iv">intravenous (iv) administration</h2>
<p>The &quot;absorption&quot; phase is the time it takes to inject the drug. Usually 
  iv injections are made quickly so that the plasma concentration reaches an almost 
  instantaneous peak and rapidly declines as the drug is distributed away to other 
  tissues. However, intravenous injections can be made with an infusion pump so 
  that the rate of &quot;absorption&quot; can be directly controlled. This is 
  usually only necessary during anaesthesia or intensive care where potentially 
  dangerous drugs are given to sick animals.<br />
    <br />
  Intravenous injections are usually only used where the drug has to act rapidly 
  (anaesthetics and sedatives), which have to be given in large volumes (fluids) 
  or which are irritant (parenteral nutrition solutions).<br />
    <br />
  Any superficial vein can be used: in dogs and cats the cephalic vein is usually used, although the lateral (dogs) or medial 
    (cats) saphenous vein is also used. In cattle, sheep and horses, the jugular 
  vein is used. In pigs and rabbits, the marginal 
  ear vein is used. In animals with long tails, such as possums, the lateral tail vein can be used. In animals in shock, where drugs have to be given into collapsed 
  veins, it is sometimes necessary to <a href="../cardiofiles/cardCutDown.html">cut down</a> onto the vein to place an iv catheter. </p>
  <p><a href="PKsAdminPix.html#iv">pictures</a></p>
<h2 id="oral">oral (po) administration</h2>
<p>The surface area of gut available for absorption of the drug is the most important
  factor effecting the rate of absorption. Disease processes such as gastroenteritis,
  neoplastic infiltration or villus atrophy may significantly change the available
  absorptive surface area. This should be taken into account before the administration
  of an oral medication.<br />
  Dilution of the drug by administration with feed or with fluid would retard the
  rate of drug absorption since the drug diffuses down a concentration gradient.
  Some foods contain substances which bind to the drug, preventing absorption.</p>
<p>The
  concentration gradient is the main factor affecting the rate of drug absorption
  (rather than purely the drug concentration in the gut). Therefore, the drug
  concentration in the blood or extravascular fluid is also an important determinant
  of the rate
  of drug absorption. Factors which affect the drug concentration in the blood
  or extravascular fluid include the rate of distribution and the rate of elimination
  of the drug. More importantly, in the local environment of the absorptive process,
  the rate of blood flow and / or lymph flow determines to a large extent the
  steepness of the concentration gradient. Blood flow and lymph flow are dependent
  upon the
  timing of the drug administration with respect to meals, exercise and other
  variants of cardiac output.</p>
<p>Drug absorption can also be altered by alterations
  in the permeability of the gut wall. Diseases such as infiltrative neoplasia,
  inflammatory bowel disease
  and mucosal injuries by viruses, bacteria, parasites and caustic chemicals
  can all increase the rate of absorption of drugs. In addition increases in
  the permeability
  of the gut wall can result in the absorption of drugs not normally absorbed
  from the gut. Obviously, if the animal vomits its medication up, the drug
  will not
  be absorbed. Gastroenteritis usually results in a faster than normal passage
  of gut contents, the drug may not be there long enough to be fully absorbed.
  Therefore care needs to be taken in consideration of administration of all
  drugs to animals with gastrointestinal disease.</p>
<h2 id="im">intramuscular (im) administration</h2>
<p>
  Surface area can be altered by injecting a given dose in aliquots to multiple
  sites, thus increasing the rate of absorption. The concentration of drug in
  the injection will also determine the steepness of the diffusion gradient for
  drug absorption. The concentration of the drug
  in the injection might be altered after injection due to a formulation which
  is not isosmolar. Drug concentration in the tissue fluid will also effect the
  diffusion gradient. Both the rates of lymph and blood flow vary from muscle to
  muscle and also vary dependent upon on exercise, cardiac output and catacholamine
  release.</p>
<p>The pH in the muscle may vary from one muscle to another as a function
  of exercise and tissue perfusion. Therefore difference in the rate of absorption
  of an intramuscular
  injection will vary dependent upon the formulation used and the injection site.
  The cranial third of the neck is the preferred site in food animals (both for
  better absorption and reduced residues in edible meat), the quadriceps or deltoid
  muscles in small animals (although im injections are not often used in small
  animals because they are painful).<br />
  There are only a few examples where the permeability of blood vessels in the
  area of an injection might significantly alter the expected rate of drug absorption.
  In particular, it is important to ensure that an injection is not made into
  an inflamed area where blood vessel permeability might be expected to have
  changed.
  The proximity of the injection to impermeable boundaries such as fascial plains
  and fat is an important determinant of the rate of drug absorption after intramuscular
  administration and is to some extent controllable by appropriate choice of
  injection site.</p>
<p>If an &quot;intramuscular&quot; injection actually goes into
  fat (easy with pigs) or between fascial planes (easy with cats), absorption
  will be variable but probably
  much slower than expected. If it goes into a vein, absorption will be much
  faster than expected, resulting in a relative overdose of organs with a high
  blood flow,
  and probably side effects.</p>
    <p><a href="PKsAdminPix.html#im">pictures</a></p>

<h2 id="sc">subcutaneous (sc) administration</h2>
<p><br />
  The rate of absorption is likely to be similar / slower than an intramuscular
  injection but much more variable because of differences in the rates of blood
  and lymph flow to the skin due to species, gender, age, environmental temperature
  and body temperature. Care needs to be taken that the drug is not given into
  fat but is truly subcutaneous, since fat is poorly perfused. The usual site is
  over the ribs, or in the scruff in small animals.</p>
<h2 id="imamm">intramammary administration</h2>
<p><br />
  In cows with mastitis, the usual route of drug administration is intramammary.
  The drugs either directly affect bacteria in the milk or cross into macrophages
  and mucosal cells where the bacteria are hiding. Significant systemic absorption
  can occur; with dry cow therapy, nearly all the drug is absorbed systemically
  and eliminated. Great care is needed to ensure that dirt on the end of the teat
  is not injected as well as the drug.</p>
<h2 id="spinal">spinal administration</h2>
<p>Drugs can be given epidurally (between the dura mater and the periosteum)
  or intrathecally (between the dura mater and the spinal cord). Analgesic drugs
  such as local anaesthetics are the only drugs usually given by these routes.</p>
    <p><a href="PKsAdminPix.html#spinal">pictures</a></p>

<h2 id="other">other routes of administration</h2>
<p><strong><a href="PKsAdminPix.html#topical">Transdermal patches</a></strong> containing drugs can be applied to hairless skin. The drug is absorbed either by simple diffusion (which is slow), by solvent carrier assisted diffusion (which can be faster) or by voltage assisted diffusion. Transdermal patches containing <a href="../CNSfiles/CNSopDr.html">fentanyl</a> have potential for the administration of analgesia to animals both for chronic pain and for acute pain post-operatively. They are often used in people and have been used clinically in dogs, horses and pigs. There are species differences in absorption, but they usually take 24 hours to reach analgesic concentrations in the brain, which limits their usefulness as it means that vets have to plan ahead.</p>
<p>Other <strong>topically</strong> administered drugs may be absorbed transdermally
  also. Sometimes this absorption is by design and sometimes an accident, resulting
  usually from
  a breakdown of the cutaneous barrier. Breakdowns of the cutaneous barrier occur
  with disease processes such as inflammation and where wounds exist. Drugs used
  in this way include nitroglycerine (see cardiovascular notes) and many anthelmintics
  for large animals. Care is necessary as in some circumstances the skin can
  act as a reservoir of drug. It is worth bearing in mind that any drug designed to cross an animal's skin will also cross human skin - sell the owner some rubber gloves.</p>
<p>Drugs applied <a href="PKsAdminPix.html#topical">topically to
  the eye</a> or <strong>subconjunctivally</strong> in the treatment of ocular disease are frequently
  absorbed systemically. There have been cases
  of iatrogenic
  Cushing's syndrome being caused by steroid administration in topical preparations
  to the eye of the dog.</p>
<p>The administration of drugs by <strong>rectal</strong> suppository is
  not often used in veterinary medicine. Very little work has been done studying
  the pharmacokinetics of
  rectal suppositories in domestic animals. However, this route of administration
  may
  be appropriate for administering drugs to animals with upper gastrointestinal
  disease or with protracted vomiting. <br />
  In large animal practice drugs are sometimes administered in pessary form
  into the lumen of the uterus. Many drugs administered in this fashion are
  absorbed
  systemically - may be important with respect to drug withholding times
  for slaughter.</p>
<p>Some soluble drugs can be applied by nebulisation and <strong>inhalation</strong> of the resulting aerosol. These drugs are used mainly for local treatment
  of respiratory
  tract
  disease. Doses need to be calculated carefully because systemic absorption
  does occur through the mucosa. Drugs which can be used this way include mucolytics, antibiotics and &#946; adrenergic agonists. In emergencies, adrenaline is sometimes given intra-tracheally and is absored rapidly across the mucosa (see <a href="../cardioFiles/cardCPR.html">CPR</a>).</p>
<p><a href="../CNSfiles/CNSgAinhAn.html"><strong>Volatile anaesthetics</strong></a> are administered by inhalation and absorbed very rapidly across the alveolar membranes.</p>
<p>Drugs applied to the <strong>nasal</strong> mucosa can be
  rapidly absorbed. This route is undergoing investigation in people for the
  administration of peptides,
  which would be
  broken down in the gut if given orally. Many new drugs are peptides,
  so
  this route may
  become more important in future.</p>
<p>The <strong>intraperitoneal</strong> route is sometimes used, particularly in laboratory animals
  and lambs. Do not give drugs by this route unless there is no alternative.</p>
<p><b>Intraosseous administration</b> has been advocated for <a href="../cardioFiles/cardFluTher.html">fluids</a> in puppies and kittens. Injections by this route are extremely painful in man, when a neonatal animal is so sick as to be unable to fight back it is hardly sporting to subject it to excruciating pain as well. Infection is another problem when using this route - the consequences are likely to be disastrous. This route of administration has been revived in <a href="http://www.ramcjournal.com/2007/dec07/cooper2.pdf">human military anaesthesia</a> - it can be tricky to put in an iv line in the back of a helicopter flying tactically at night!</p>
