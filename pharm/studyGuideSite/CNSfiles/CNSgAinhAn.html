  <h1>Inhalation anaesthesia</h1>
  <p>After anaesthesia has been induced with an injectable drug it is often maintained with an inhalation drug. This also allows the animal to be given supplementary oxygen (30% minimum). Anaesthesia can also be induced with inhalation agents but is usually slow and unpleasant for the animal since these drugs usually produce an excitement phase before surgical anaesthesia. Sevoflurane and desflurane are much better but it is still difficult to get animals to cooperate when you say &#8220;take a deep breath...&#8221;. One exception is young foals and calves, where it may be possible to place a nasopharyngeal tube and induce anaesthesia with gas.</p>
  <p>Advantages of inhalation anaesthesia are control of the airway (since the animal is nearly always <a href="images/intub.mov" onClick="NewWindow(this.href,'name','400','320','yes');return false"> intubated</a>), ventilation (IPPV) and <a href="CNSinhPK.html">uptake and elimination</a> of drug. The disadvantages are that expensive equipment is needed and possible equipment failure is dangerous for the animal (especially the obsolete and unmaintained equipment which seems to end up in veterinary practices).</p>
  <h2>Anaesthesia - inhalation drugs</h2>
  <p><a href="CNSgAinhAn.html">table of physical properties</a></p>
  <p><strong><a name="hal"></a>Halothane</strong> is the most important inhalation anaesthetic in veterinary anaesthesia by a long way (at the moment). It is a good general purpose anaesthetic but not a very good analgesic (use with nitrous oxide or injectable analgesic). It is also a poor muscle relaxant. It is best used as the hypnotic part of a balanced anaesthesia technique. Its side effects include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>respiratory depression (dose dependent)</li>
    <li>reduced cardiac output</li>
    <li>vasodilatation</li>
    <li>sensitises heart to adrenaline</li>
    <li>(halothane hepatitis)</li>
    <li>(malignant hyperthermia in pigs)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When used alone, to provide surgical anaesthesia (ie, high doses), cardiorespiratory depression can be severe. If not enough halothane is used, the combination of halothane and adrenaline can cause tachyarrhythmias, especially in cats.</p>
  <p>Halothane hepatitis is a cause of (unnecessary?) worry in human anaesthesia - halothane has been largely replaced by isoflurane (particularly in the USA) and may be withdrawn in the future. Hepatitis after halothane is not a problem in domestic animals but concern about operating theatre staff may cause controls on atmospheric pollution (see scavenging below).</p>
  <p>Malignant hyperthermia occurs in some breeds of pig (and people), particularly Pietrain and some families of Landrace pigs. If the pig starts to go hot and rigid, turn off the halothane immediately and ventilate with 100% oxygen. It may also need to be hosed down with cold water. The problem is caused by a mutation of the ryanodine receptor, which controls calcium flux out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The definitive treatment is dantrolene (ryanodine receptor antagonist), but it is rarely available. Malignant hyperthermia can also occur in other species but is rare. Halothane is sometimes deliberately used in pigs to detect if they are carrying the MH genes (MH is also induced by stress and lowers the value of the meat). About 30% of commercial pigs in 
    NZ have the MH gene. Pigs have been extensively studied as a model for MH in people; but little is known about it in other species.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="iso"></a>Isoflurane</strong> is similar to halothane 
    but gives a faster induction and recovery. Many dogs object to the smell. It 
    is expensive, but can be useful in sick animals or where a very fast induction 
    and recovery are required. If halothane is taken off the market, isoflurane 
    is the obvious sucessor. It may also cause MH. Like halothane, it has little 
    analgesic effect. <a name="enf"></a><strong>Enflurane</strong> is a chemical 
    isomer of isoflurane but often produces excitatory effects which make judgement 
    of depth of anaesthesia difficult. It has no obvious advantages and is not often 
    used.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="nitrous"></a>Nitrous oxide</strong> (N<sub>2</sub>O, 
    laughing gas) has been around since the 18th century. It was used as a recreational 
    drug until its analgesic properties were discovered. It is a weak anaesthetic 
    although a good analgesic so it must be used with other agents. It produces 
    a rapid induction - it equilibrates in about 10 mins. A number of problems are 
    associated with nitrous oxide:<br />
    &#8226; diffusion hypoxia - Fink effect - the opposite of the second gas effect<br />
    &#8226; diffuses into air filled spaces - beware pneumothorax and colic<br />
    &#8226; can build up in circle systems - oxygen analyser must be used or run 
    the system semi closed.<br />
    &#8226; depresses folate metabolism (long term use &gt; 8 hours)<br />
    Since it is a gas, it comes in cylinders and requires pressure regulators, flow 
    regulators etc (more equipment to break down!). However, it is well worth the 
    bother. The main reason to use it is that its analgesic properties mean that 
    much less halothane can be used. This either means smoother anaesthesia or faster 
    recoveries, depending on how it is used.</p>
  <h2>New drugs</h2>
  <p>The newer agents <strong><a name="des"></a>desflurane</strong> and <strong><a name="sevo"></a>sevoflurane</strong> are not yet fully evaluated 
    in animals (but give a very fast induction and recovery in man). Desflurane 
    is very good in theory but requires special (very expensive) vaporisers. Sevoflurane 
    has been used in horses, pigs and birds. Some paediatric anaesthetists use them 
    for induction (takes 10 - 60 seconds) and then switch to halothane or isoflurane 
    for maintenance. They may have their use depending on price. Sevoflurane is 
    catching on in human anaesthesia and getting cheaper all the time.</p>
  <h2> Old drugs</h2>
  <p>Older agents include <strong><a name="trilene"></a>trichoroethylene</strong> which is almost obselete but worth using in some circumstances. It is a very 
    good analgesic but a poor muscle relaxant and is best used in combination with 
    another agent such as halothane - low dose halothane keeps the animal asleep 
    and trichloroethylene provides the analgesia. It gives a very slow induction 
    and recovery but good analgesia during recovery. Do not use in a closed system 
    with soda lime - reacts to produce phosgene. (Anaesthetic or HPLC grade trichloroethylene 
    should be used for anaesthesia; it is also one of the commonest industrial solvents 
    but solvent grade is full of toxic impurities.)<br />
    Diethyl <strong><a name="ether"></a>ether</strong> (= ether) is almost obselete 
    and should be avoided in most circumstances. It is a good anaesthetic but very 
    inflammable in air, and explosive in oxygen. Its vapour is heavier than air 
    and will roll along the floor and under doors. It gives a slow induction and 
    recovery. The only reason it is still around is that it is the only agent which 
    can be used without supplementary oxygen as it stimulates respiration (but if 
    oxygen is available use it). It is irritant to the airways (peroxide degradation 
    products) - anticholinergic premed required.<br />
    <strong><a name="methoxy"></a>Methoxyflurane</strong> is not available in NZ 
    and is almost obselete. It gives a very slow induction and recovery, but is 
    a very good analgesic and a good muscle relaxant so is useful for long orthopaedic 
    ops. It is extensively metabolised releasing free fluoride ions which may cause 
    kidney damage (particularly in combination with NSAIDs).<br />
    <strong><a name="chloro"></a>Chloroform</strong> used to be used in horses because 
    it was cheap. It causes massive liver necrosis in hypoxia and is very good at 
    sensitising the heart to adrenaline. Do not use.<br />

  <h1 id="scav">Scavenging waste gases </h1>
  <p>There has been concern about the effects of occupational exposure to small 
    amounts of anaesthetic drugs in the atmosphere. In NZ, OSH have recentlu tightened 
    guidelines on the maximum amounts permissible in room air; in Britain and the 
    USA, there are similar guidelines but with different numbers. There is no good 
    evidence that exposure to trace amounts of these drugs harms human health (with 
    the possible exception of nitrous oxide causing abortion in women) but they 
    smell nasty and are better removed. OSH have recently caught on to the fact 
    that vets do not worry about this - so be warned!</p>
  <p>A number of things can be done to reduce pollution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>fill vaporisers in a well ventilated place (out of doors?) without spillage.</li>
    <li>fill vaporisers at the end of a day before you go home rather than 
      in the morning before you start work</li>
    <li>turn vaporisers off when not in use</li>
    <li>use low fresh gas flow rates</li>
    <li>check equipment for leaks</li>
    <li>anaesthetic agents are good for removing stains from clothes but try 
      to resist the temptation to do this!</li>
    <li>scavenge waste gases - but make sure the system does not impose any 
      extra work for the animal</li>
    <li>in the last resort, open the window!

  <h1 id="fish"> Fish anaesthesia </h1>
  <p>When fish have to be anaesthetised, they are given drugs in their water which 
    are absorbed across the gills and could thus be classified as &#8220;inhalation 
    anaesthetics&#8221;.</p>
  <p><strong>Tricaine</strong> methanesulphonate (tricaine mesylate, MS222) is commonly 
    used and probably best. It comes as a powder which needs to be dissolved in 
    aerated fresh water (not tap water) or sea water as appropriate. <strong>Phenoxyethanol</strong> is an oily liquid which can be useful but may be carcinogenic. It dissolves 
    some plastics. <strong>Benzocaine</strong> (dissolved in ethanol or acetone 
    stock solution) has been used, deep anaesthesia not reliable. A mixture of clove 
    oil and detergent (<strong>Aqui S</strong>) has been developed in NZ to allow 
    handling of salmon. It is sedative rather than anaesthetic and may cause stress 
    (fish generally do not like detergent - it damages their gills). <strong>Ether</strong> can be used at a pinch.</p>
