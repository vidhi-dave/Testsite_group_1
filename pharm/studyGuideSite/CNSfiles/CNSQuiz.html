		multiList: [
			{
				ques: "Local anaesthetics produce clinically useful effects when given",
				ans: "around a nerve",
				ansSel: ["onto the skin", "by mouth", "per rectum", "intramuscularly"],
				ansInfo: ["Local anaesthetics have to be applied directly on to nerves or nerve endings to work. While they can work on the skin, they must be given in an ointment which penetrates the skin to access the nerve endings.They are metabolised rapidly in the plasma or liver if given systemically."],
			},
			{
				ques: "General anaesthesia",
				ans: "may be induced with xenon",
				ansSel: ["is an inability to respond to surgery", "is similar to the effect produced by LSD", "always involves excitation","includes cardiovascular depression"],
				ansInfo: ["General anaesthesia (loss of feeling) must be distinguished from ability to respond which could be a motor effect, eg, muscle relaxation. Most of the inert gases can produce anaesthesia, xenon is the only one which is of practical use (but far too expensive).LSD produces hallucinations by interfering with 5HT transmission, it does not produce anaesthesia. Very light anaesthesia can produce excitement through disinhibition. Many, but not all, anaesthetic drugs produce cardiovascular depression."],
			},
			{
				ques: "General anaesthetic drugs",
				ans: "potentiate GABA A receptors",
				ansSel: ["potentiate GABA B receptors", "are only effective in mammals", "open sodium channels at normal doses", "raise intracellular calcium levels"],
				ansInfo: ["Most general anaesthetics are thought to work by potentiating the effect of GABA at GABA A receptors. They may also block calcium channels to prevent a rise in intracellular calcium, but do not affect most other receptors at clinical concentrations (with the possible exception of acetylcholine receptors). Although it is difficult to define anaesthesia in submammalian animals, anaesthetics produce similar effects."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Codeine",
				ans: "depresses the cough reflex",
				ansSel: ["often causes diarrhoea", "is used to treat vomiting caused by morphine", "is equipotent to morphine as an analgesic", "is an alkaloid produced by ergot"],
				ansInfo: ["Codeine is derived from opium. It is used to treat diarrhoea and coughing. It causes vomiting by the same mechanism as morphine, but is much less potent - 0.1 - 0.01 times."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Analgesia",
				ans: "may be produced by &#945;2 agonists in the sheep",
				ansSel: ["means a lack of feeling", "means a blockade of the nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord", "is the same as anaesthesia", "may be produced by intrathecal injection of substance P"],
				ansInfo: ["Analgesia is an inability to feel pain. Unconsciousness, anaesthesia and blockade of neuronal pathways may produce analgesia but are not the same thing. Intrathecal substance P causes pain. While it is not possible to prove beyond all doubt that sheep can feel pain, &#945;2 agonists do exactly the same in sheep as they do in people, where they do produce analgesia."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Which drug would be the first choice for treating status epilepticus in a dog?",
				ans: "diazepam",
				ansSel: ["acepromazine", "lignocaine", "phenobarbitone", "suxamethonium"],
				ansInfo: ["Acepromazine can cause seizures, probably by inducing a Parkinsonâ€™s type syndrome. Diazepam is clinically useful for the short term (minutes) control of seizures. Lignocaine can both stop and cause seziures at different doses, it is not used for this! Phenobarbitone is the drug of choice for preventing siezures in animals in most circumstances, and the second line drug for status epilepticus. Suxamethonium is a muscle relaxant, it should NOT be used."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Thiopentone sodium",
				ans: "has an elimination half life of about 4.5h in the dog",
				ansSel: ["5% solution has a pH of about 4", "is one of the best drugs for maintenance of anaesthesia", "does not cause cardiovascular depression", "does not cross the placenta"],
				ansInfo: ["5% thiopentone has a pH of about 11 (it comes out of solution at a lower pH). It has a metabolic half life of about 4.5 hours in the dog and so accumulates if used for maintenance. A bolus of thiopentone usually causes transient cardiovascular depression but can make shock worse. The placenta is functionally similar to the blood brain barrier; all anaesthetics cross both. Thiopentone has a distribution half life of about 7 min and an elimination half life of about 4.5h in the dog."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Detomidine",
				ans: "produces analgesia in horses",
				ansSel: ["is a phenothiazine sedative", "produces anaesthesia in horses", "may have its effects reversed by flumazenil", "usually causes tachycardia in horses"],
				ansInfo: ["Acepromazine is the only phenothiazine in common use. Detomidine is an &#945;2 agonist and its effects can be reversed by any &#945;2 antagonist, but not flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. It produces analgesia as well as sedation in most species. It causes hypertension in horses, this produces reflex bradycardia."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Local anaesthetic use dependence means that",
				ans: "rapidly firing neurones are preferentially blocked",
				ansSel: ["animals become tolerant to the effects", "drugs must get into the sodium channel from inside the neurone", "C fibres are preferentially blocked", "bupivacaine is a useful antiarrhythmic"],
				ansInfo: ["Local anaesthetics bind to sodium channels in the open or inactivvated state: a rapidly firing neurone will have more channels in these states so the drugs will be more effective. Preferential blockade of C fibres is usually called differential block."],
			},
			{
				ques: "You need to sedate a dog which has been in a road traffic accident for X rays. The dog has a fractured femur, a suspected fractured pelvis and is going into shock. The best course of action is to",
				ans: "give it a big dose of morphine, treat the shock and X ray it",
				ansSel: ["wait and see what happens", "treat the shock, immobilise the fractures and forget about the X rays", "give it acepromazine, X ray it quickly, then decide what to do", "euthanise the dog"],
				ansInfo: ["The dog will be in pain, which is likely to cause excitement, particularly when the dog is moved, so an analgesic is indicated as well as fracture immobilisation. The dog should be treated for shock, and drugs such as acepromazine which cause vasodilatation should be avoided. Euthanasia is a last resort, doing nothing is not an ethical option."],
