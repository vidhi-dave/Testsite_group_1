<h1>Sedatives - &#945;2 agonists</h1>
<p>Adrenergic &#945;2 agonists are widely used, especially in large animals, for 
  chemical restraint. They are also effective analgesics and possibly the most 
  effective class of analgesic drugs in ruminants. &#945;2 antagonists are available 
  and are usually used to reverse sedation but will also reverse analgesia. This 
  is rarely desirable.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226;analgesia<br>
    &#8226;sedation<br>
    &#8226;bradycardia<br>
    &#8226;rise then fall in arterial blood pressure<br>
    &#8226;spasm then relaxation of gut<br>
    &#8226;muscle relaxation<br>
    &#8226;vomiting (30% of dogs &amp; 40% of cats)<br>
    &#8226;hypoxaemia (ruminants)<br>
    &#8226;hypothermia</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="drugs">Drugs</h2>
<p><strong>Xylazine</strong> has been around since the 1960s for animals, <strong>clonidine</strong> 
  (human drug) is nearly as old. Interest has recently revived in these drugs 
  with <strong>detomidine</strong>, <strong>medetomidine</strong> (one stereoisomer, 
  <strong>dexmedetomidine</strong>, is currently undergoing clinical trials in 
  people) and <strong>romifidine</strong> (an ancient analogue of clonidine which 
  has been brought back from the dead). These drugs have slightly different specificity 
  for &#945;2 subtypes, but there is no clear relationship with their clinical 
  properties. Xylazine has traditionally been used in all species, especially 
  ruminants which are much more sensitive to its effects than other species, medetomidine 
  in dogs and cats, and the others in horses. They are primarily used for their 
  sedative effects but are also useful analgesics.</p>
<h2 id="mech">Mechanism</h2>
<p>Adrenergic &#945;2 receptors are G protein coupled receptors which increase 
  K<sup>+</sup> conduction in same way as opioids (and probably at the same ion 
  channels (GIRK2)) and so hyperpolarise neurones.</p>
<h2 id="sites">Sites of action</h2>
<p><em>analgesia</em> - spinal cord, (locus coeruleus)(some species differences)</p>
<p><em>sedation</em> - locus coeruleus (ascending reticular formation)</p>
<p><em>cardiovascular effects</em> - This can cause confusion. These drugs cause 
  hypertension and bradycardia followed by hypotension. The hypertension is caused 
  by a direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle in resistance arterioles in 
  some vascular beds such as the skin (big arteries are unaffected). The hypotension 
  is caused by an inhibition of the vasomotor centre in the medulla, the thoracic 
  sympathetic outflow and the release of noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings. 
  The hypertension usually causes marked vagally mediated reflex bradycardia which 
  is potentiated by reduced release of adrenaline and noradrenaline. <br>
  Cardiac output can be dramatically reduced - by up to 70%.<br>
  Most of the clinically used drugs contain an imidazoline ring and so bind to 
  imidazoline receptors. The exact function of these is unknown but I1 receptors 
  are thought to be involved in blood pressure control - some imidazolines which 
  are not also adrenergic &#945;2 agonists have been used to lower blood pressure 
  in man. Imidazoline I2 receptors appearto be on monoamine oxidase B and may 
  also be involved in depression. I3 receptors are involved with insulin release 
  from the pancreas. &#945;2 agonists certainly reduce insulin production and 
  thus cause a temporary hyperglycaemia.</p>
<p><em>respiratory effects</em> - Xylazine appears to cause bronchoconstriction 
  (and possibly pulmonary artery constriction) in ruminants; it may also 
  cause pulmonary oedema. Animals become hypoxic, sometimes severely. It will kill 1.7 deer in 1000. This also occurs with the other drugs, but their use in ruminants is not sufficient for it to show up. It is probably caused by the release of various inflammatory mediators from pulmonary intravascular macrophages.</p> 
  <p>Respiratory depressant effects are minimal.</p>
<h2 id="routes">Routes of administration</h2>
<p>usually im (small animals), iv (large animals)<br>
  poorly absorbed sc - blood vessel constriction<br>
  spinal administration gives long lasting analgesia without side effects and 
  is clinically useful in ruminants and horses </p>
<h2 id="sed">Use as sedatives</h2>
<p>These drugs are especially useful in large animals and have superceded everything 
  else. Xylazine has been around for longest and is still widely use in a variety 
  of species. Ruminants are much more sensitive to xylazine than other species 
  - they require much lower doses. Rams and bulls are much more variable in their 
  dose requirements than females and castrated males. Xylazine appears to cause 
  bronchoconstriction in cattle and sheep; it may also cause pulmonary oedema. 
  It will produce a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in many deer; this is fatal 
  in 1.7 animals in 1000.</p>
<p>Detomidine was introduced about 10 years ago for use in the horse and is now 
  the standard sedative in this species, although it works in most other species 
  too. A derivative, medetomidine is used in small animals. Medetomidine is slightly 
  more sedative than the others but it is not possible to produce anaesthesia 
  with it alone in most of the species we deal with (cf. rats and man). Clonidine 
  was the original (human) drug; it was first marketed as a nasal decongestant 
  until it was noticed that it reduced blood pressure. It was then marketed as 
  a hypotensive until it was noticed that it also produced sedation and analgesia, 
  when it began to be used in anaesthesia and pain clinics. The moral of this 
  story is that these drugs have lots of side effects! Romifidine is a clonidine 
  analogue which was developed at the same time but shelved because of its sedative 
  side effects. It has now been resurrected for horses. It is similar to the others 
  but longer acting.</p>
<h2 id="antag">Antagonists</h2>
<p>One attraction of &#945;2 agonists, particularly in small animals and deer, 
  is that it is possible to reverse the sedation with antagonists. <strong>Atipamezole</strong> 
  (small animals) and <strong>yohimbine</strong> (deer) are used, although there 
  are many more specific experimental drugs such as <strong>idazoxan</strong> 
  (&#945;2 antagonists were examined as antidepressants for man a few years ago). 
  Remember that all the effects of the &#945;2 agonist will be reversed, including 
  any analgesia.</p>
<h2 id="future">The future?</h2>
<p>Orexins, acting on OX1 receptors on noradrenergic neurones in the locus coeruleus, 
  increase arousal. OX1 antagonists may potentiate or even replace &#945;2 agonists.<br>
