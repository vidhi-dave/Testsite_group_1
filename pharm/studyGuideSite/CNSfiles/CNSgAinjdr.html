  <h1>Injection anaesthesia</h1>
  <p>Anaesthesia is usually induced by injecting a rapidly acting drug <a href="../PKsFiles/PKsiv.html">intravenously</a>. 
    The advantages of this are that it is easy, a precise dose can be given, there 
    is a rapid onset of anaesthesia (no excitement stage) and only a syringe and 
    needle are required. The disadvantage is that there is no control over waking 
    - if you give too much you are in trouble.</p>
  <p>The ideal iv anaesthetic would be reliable, quick acting, produce no excitment 
    on induction, have no side effects, be rapidly metabolised, produce good muscle 
    relaxation, be analgesic, non-irritant and water soluble but it is non existant!</p>
  
  <h2><Commonly used drugs></h2>
  <p>Barbiturates, and particularly thiopentone (thiopental USAN: all 
    the barbiturates end in al in American), have always been the drugs most commonly 
    used, although they have recently been overtaken by propofol in human anaesthesia.</p>
  <p><a name="thio"></a><strong>Thiopentone</strong> comes as powder 
    mixed with NaCO3. It is unstable when made up as aqueous solution but keeps 
    for three days in a fridge. It is used as 2.5% solution (pH 11) in most dogs, 
    1.25% in small dogs / cats, 10% in large animals.<br />
    It produces rapid anaesthesia in one circulation time. It is not analgesic, 
    there is some evidence that it is hyperalgesic. It is a potent respiratory depressant. 
    There is usually transient apnoea after an induction dose - ventilate the animal. 
    It produces transient depression (usually only 2- 3 minutes) of cardiac output 
    and blood pressure. It is only used for induction of anaesthesia (cumulation 
    occurs if used for maintenance (half life about 4.5 hours in dogs) - very slow 
    recovery).<br />
    Problems with thiopentone are largely caused by overdosage (see pharmacokinetics 
    above). Muscle relaxation is not always good enough for intubation unless a 
    premed has been given (in people they often use suxamethonium to aid intubation). 
    There are breed variations; greyhounds and similar dogs have a slow recovery. 
    Extravascular injection will cause skin necrosis (high pH, especially more concentrated 
    solutions) - inject lignocaine &plusmn; saline around area. Intra-arterial injection 
    will cause pain, necrosis and possibly convulsions, probably because the thiopentone 
    crystallises out and causes arterial spasm.<br />
    <br />
    <a name="propofol"></a><strong>Propofol</strong> is not a barbiturate but is 
    clinically very similar to thiopentone. It comes as a white emulsion in single 
    use vials under nitrogen which is non irritant (but can cause mild pain in some 
    people, thought to be mediated by P2X receptors). Its major advantage over thiopentone 
    is that it is metabolised quickly in most species (except some cats) (half life 
    about 40 mins in dogs). Its disadvantages are mild excitatory effects (usually 
    front leg paddling in about 10% of dogs, although opisthotonus can occur) and 
    occasionally rough recovery. It can cause hallucinations in people which often 
    takes the form of sexual disinhibition in women! It is expensive, but coming 
    down in price. The vehicle contains egg yolk and coconut oil and is an ideal 
    growing medium for bacteria - open ampoules must be thrown away. There have 
    been some suspected deaths from septicaemia in dogs after using old propofol. 
    Wound infections are three times more likely after propofol anaesthesia - possibly 
    because people are tempted to use old propofol.<br />
    New derivatives of propofol which are water soluble and more potent are being 
    developed.</p>
  <p><a name="alphaxalone"></a>&#8220;Saffan&#8221; (&#8220;Althesin&#8221;) 
    is a mixture of the steroids <strong>alphaxalone</strong> and alphadalone. The 
    alphaxalone is thought to produce most of the anaesthesia, with the alphadolone 
    was originally included to help dissolve the alphaxalone. However, recent work 
    indicates that the alphadolone may have significant analgesic effect. It is 
    a good anaesthetic and is rapidly metabolised, even in cats. However, the vehicle 
    (polyethoxylated castor oil - &quot;Cremaphore EL&quot;) causes massive histamine 
    release in dogs so it is not used in dogs (although a technique of premeding 
    with massive doses of antihistamines has been described - not recommended). 
    Cats sometimes get oedema of the paws and ears after Saffan; the incidence of 
    this can be reduced by injecting the drug more slowly (use a 25 SWG needle). 
    It is only commonly used in cats although it is a good anaesthetic in most species 
    except the dog. Because of its rapid metabolism it can be used for long term 
    anaesthesia / sedation such as intensive care situations. Recoveries can be 
    excitable if the cat is disturbed. Althesin used to be a popular human anaesthesic 
    but was withdrawn a few years ago after similar problems with the vehicle. Saffan 
    is the remaining stocks left after withdrawal of the human drug - when these 
    are used up Saffan may be withdrawn too.<br />
    A new preparation of alphaxalone dissolved in cyclodextrin and water is now 
    available (&#8220;Alfaxan CD&#8221;). This is also suitable for dogs and is 
    likely to be widely used if it compares with thiopentone or even propofol on 
    price.<br />
    Other steroid anaesthetics are under development (although all the candidates 
    so far also cause excitatory effects on recovery). They will be water soluble 
    to avoid the problems with the vehicle.</p>
  <p><a name="ketamine"></a><strong>Ketamine</strong> is rather different 
    from the other induction agents. It is a dissociative anaesthetic, which means 
    (in people anyway) that the patient is conscious but not aware of what is being 
    done to them. This may be because it is a good analgesic and completely blocks 
    the memory! It produces no cardiovascular depression at normal doses. It acts 
    rapidly by any route (although it is painful by im or sc injection - pH4). Its 
    main disadvantage is that is produces no muscle relaxation and can actually 
    cause convulsions in dogs and horses. It is used alone in cats and monkeys and 
    combined with other drugs in other species (see below). It is also abused by 
    some drug addicts, and although it is not (yet) a controlled drug in NZ, it 
    should be locked up. Cats behave strangely for several hours after injection 
    (<a href="CNSketacat.html">movie</a>). <strong>Tiletamine</strong> is a similar 
    drug which comes premixed with zolazepam (benzodiazepine sedative).</p>
  <h2 id="obsolesc">Obsolescent drugs</h2>
  <p><strong>Methohexitone</strong> is barbiturate which is similar 
    but shorter acting than thiopentone. It usually produces excitation on induction 
    and recovery - heavy premed required. It produces much more respiratory depression 
    than thiopentone. Its only real indication was for induction in greyhounds but 
    it has been overtaken by propofol. It is now difficult to obtain.<br />
    <strong>Pentobarbitone</strong> is rarely used for anaesthesia any more. It 
    gives a slower induction and is longer acting than thiopentone. Its main use 
    is for euthanasia, although it can be used for anaesthesia in sheep - faster 
    metabolism than most species. It is sometimes used for long term sedation in 
    dogs (eg, metaldehyde poisoning). Do not use euthanasia mixtures for anaesthesia 
    - they are not sterile.<br />
    <strong>Metomidate</strong> and the human analogue <strong>etomidate</strong> are not available in NZ and are mainly of historical interest, although etomidate 
    is currently undergoing a revival in veterinary anaesthesia in the USA. They 
    produce anaesthesia but no analgesia and are traditionally used in pigs. Etomidate 
    may be of advantage in sick dogs since cardiovascular depression is minimal. 
    Analgesic premed is required for a smooth induction, and sedative premed to 
    stop twitching. Etomidate has been abandoned by human anaesthesia because it 
    causes profound adrenocortical depression.</p>
  <p><strong>Thiamylal</strong> was used in the USA instead of thiopentone 
    but is no longer available, it was clinically indistuingishable.</p>
  <h2 id="obsolete">Obsolete drugs</h2>
  <p>Laboratory animals are sometimes given these drugs in an attempt 
    to produce long acting anaesthesia with minimal cardiovascular depression. In 
    nearly every case, modern drugs properly administered would be better for the 
    animals and give more reliable results for the experimenter.<br />
    &#945; <strong>chloralose</strong> produces 8 -10 hours of stable light anaesthesia 
    in rodents, but no analgesia. It may have a place in some situations.<br />
    <strong>Urethane</strong> is similar, but has more analgesia. It is carcinogenic. 
    Do not use.<br />
    <strong>Chloral</strong> hydrate in overdose will produce a state bordering 
    on general anaesthesia, but with no analgesia. Do not use.<br />
    <strong>Tribromoethanol</strong> has nothing to recommend it. It must be given 
    ip and is very irritant. It quickly decomposes to even more irritant metabolites. 
    It should never be used.</p>
  <h2 id="comb">Combinations</h2>
  <p>neuroleptanalgesics<br />
    sedative &amp; hypnotic<br />
    &#945;2 agonist &amp; ketamine<br />
    benzodiazepine (midazolam) &amp; ketamine<br />
    zolazepam &amp; tiletamine<br />
    The sedative overcomes the increased muscle tone produced by the ketamine.</p>
    <h1 id="euth">Euthanasia</h1>
<p>Small animals are usually killed by giving an overdose of <a href="#obsolesc">pentobarbitone</a> 
  iv. Note that these solutions are not sterile. The volume involved in killing 
  large animals this way will not fit easily into a syringe, so other drugs are 
  sometimes added. Various toxic local anaesthetics such as cinchocaine have been 
  used in an attempt to stop the heart; potassium chloride is sometimes used.</p>
<p>Premixed toxic cocktails (T61) have been used which include a 
  muscle relaxant. These should always be given iv as there have been some cases 
  of the muscle relaxant being absorbed before the sedative part of the mix - 
  not a pleasant way to go.</p>
