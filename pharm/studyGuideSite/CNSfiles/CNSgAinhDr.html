<p align="left"><strong><a name="hal"></a>Halothane</strong> is the most important 
  inhalation anaesthetic in veterinary anaesthesia by a long way. It is a good 
  general purpose anaesthetic but not a very good analgesic (use with nitrous 
  oxide or injectable analgesic). It is also a poor muscle relaxant. It is best 
  used as the hypnotic part of a balanced anaesthesia technique. Its side effects 
  include:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">&#8226;respiratory depression (dose dependent)<br>
    &#8226;reduced cardiac output<br>
    &#8226;vasodilatation<br>
    &#8226;sensitises heart to adrenaline<br>
    &#8226;(halothane hepatitis)<br>
    &#8226;(malignant hyperthermia in pigs)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">When used alone, to provide surgical anaesthesia (ie, high doses), 
  cardiorespiratory depression can be severe. If not enough halothane is used, 
  the combination of halothane and adrenaline can cause tachyarrhythmias, especially 
  in cats.</p>
<p align="left">Halothane hepatitis is a cause of (unnecessary?) worry in human 
  anaesthesia - halothane has been largely replaced by isoflurane (particularly 
  in the USA) and may be withdrawn in the future. Hepatitis after halothane is 
  not a problem in domestic animals but concern about operating theatre staff 
  may cause controls on atmospheric pollution (see scavenging below).</p>
<p align="left">Malignant hyperthermia occurs in some breeds of pig (and people), 
  particularly Pietrain and some families of Landrace pigs. If the pig starts 
  to go hot and rigid, turn off the halothane immediately and ventilate with 100% 
  oxygen. It may also need to be hosed down with cold water. The problem is caused 
  by a mutation of the ryanodine receptor, which controls calcium flux out of 
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The definitive treatment is dantrolene (ryanodine 
  receptor antagonist), but it is rarely available. Malignant hyperthermia can 
  also occur in other species but is rare. Halothane is sometimes deliberately 
  used in pigs to detect if they are carrying the MH genes (MH is also induced 
  by stress and lowers the value of the meat). About 30% of commercial pigs in 
  NZ have the MH gene. Pigs have been extensively studied as a model for MH in 
  people; but little is known about it in other species.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><a name="iso"></a>Isoflurane</strong> is similar to halothane 
  but gives a faster induction and recovery. Many dogs object to the smell. It 
  is expensive, but can be useful in sick animals or where a very fast induction 
  and recovery are required. If halothane is taken off the market, isoflurane 
  is the obvious sucessor. It may also cause MH. Like halothane, it has little 
  analgesic effect. <a name="enf"></a><strong>Enflurane</strong> is a chemical 
  isomer of isoflurane but often produces excitatory effects which make judgement 
  of depth of anaesthesia difficult. It has no obvious advantages and is not often 
  used.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><a name="nitrous"></a>Nitrous oxide</strong> (N<sub>2</sub>O, 
  laughing gas) has been around since the 18th century. It was used as a recreational 
  drug until its analgesic properties were discovered. It is a weak anaesthetic 
  although a good analgesic so it must be used with other agents. It produces 
  a rapid induction - it equilibrates in about 10 mins. A number of problems are 
  associated with nitrous oxide:<br>
  &#8226; diffusion hypoxia - Fink effect - the opposite of the second gas effect<br>
  &#8226; diffuses into air filled spaces - beware pneumothorax and colic<br>
  &#8226; can build up in circle systems - oxygen analyser must be used or run 
  the system semi closed.<br>
  &#8226; depresses folate metabolism (long term use &gt; 8 hours)<br>
  Since it is a gas, it comes in cylinders and requires pressure regulators, flow 
  regulators etc (more equipment to break down!). However, it is well worth the 
  bother. The main reason to use it is that its analgesic properties mean that 
  much less halothane can be used. This either means smoother anaesthesia or faster 
  recoveries, depending on how it is used.</p>
<h2 align="left" class="footerSG">New drugs</h2>
<p align="left">The newer agents <strong><a name="des"></a>desflurane</strong> 
  and <strong><a name="sevo"></a>sevoflurane</strong> are not yet fully evaluated 
  in animals (but give a very fast induction and recovery in man). Desflurane 
  is very good in theory but requires special (very expensive) vaporisers. Sevoflurane 
  has been used in horses, pigs and birds. Some paediatric anaesthetists use them 
  for induction (takes 10 - 60 seconds) and then switch to halothane or isoflurane 
  for maintenance. They may have their use depending on price. Sevoflurane is 
  catching on in human anaesthesia and getting cheaper all the time.</p>
<h2 align="left" class="footerSG"> Old drugs</h2>
<p align="left">Older agents include <strong><a name="trilene"></a>trichoroethylene</strong> 
  which is almost obselete but worth using in some circumstances. It is a very 
  good analgesic but a poor muscle relaxant and is best used in combination with 
  another agent such as halothane - low dose halothane keeps the animal asleep 
  and trichloroethylene provides the analgesia. It gives a very slow induction 
  and recovery but good analgesia during recovery. Do not use in a closed system 
  with soda lime - reacts to produce phosgene. (Anaesthetic or HPLC grade trichloroethylene 
  should be used for anaesthesia; it is also one of the commonest industrial solvents 
  but solvent grade is full of toxic impurities.)<br>
  Diethyl <strong><a name="ether"></a>ether</strong> (= ether) is almost obselete 
  and should be avoided in most circumstances. It is a good anaesthetic but very 
  inflammable in air, and explosive in oxygen. Its vapour is heavier than air 
  and will roll along the floor and under doors. It gives a slow induction and 
  recovery. The only reason it is still around is that it is the only agent which 
  can be used without supplementary oxygen as it stimulates respiration (but if 
  oxygen is available use it). It is irritant to the airways (peroxide degradation 
  products) - anticholinergic premed required.<br>
  <strong><a name="methoxy"></a>Methoxyflurane</strong> is not available in NZ 
  and is almost obselete. It gives a very slow induction and recovery, but is 
  a very good analgesic and a good muscle relaxant so is useful for long orthopaedic 
  ops. It is extensively metabolised releasing free fluoride ions which may cause 
  kidney damage (particularly in combination with NSAIDs).<br>
  <strong><a name="chloro"></a>Chloroform</strong> used to be used in horses because 
  it was cheap. It causes massive liver necrosis in hypoxia and is very good at 
  sensitising the heart to adrenaline. Do not use.<br>
