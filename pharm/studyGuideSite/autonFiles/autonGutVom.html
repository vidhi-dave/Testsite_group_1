<h1>Vomiting</h1>
<p><img src="images/vom-phys.gif" width="600" height="660"></p>
<p class="caption">The physiology of vomiting from a pharmacologist's point of 
  view. There are species differences in the receptors involved; (d) dog only, 
  (c) cat only. 5HT1A, 5HT3, 5HT4 - 5 hydroxy tryptamine receptors; &#945;<sub>2</sub> - adrenergic 
  receptors; D2 - dopamine receptors; GABAA - g aminobutyric acid receptors; H1, 
  H2 - histamine receptors; M1, M2 - muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, &micro; 
  - opioid receptors.</p>
<p>The main treatment for vomiting is intravenous fluids (see <a href="autonGutDiar.html">diarrhoea 
  treatment</a>).</p>
<h1>Antiemetics</h1>
<p>The physiology of vomiting is complicated with a large number of pathways and 
  neurotransmitters involved (see diagram). A wide variety of stimuli can provoke 
  vomiting by neural or humoral mechanisms which are coordinated by the vomiting 
  centre in the medulla. Antiemetics vary in their site or sites of action and 
  this influences their effectiveness in different clinical situations. Most of 
  the older dugs have been used empirically for a long time and have actions at 
  several possible sites. Blocking several sites may provide a synergistic antiemetic 
  effect, but there are species differences and our knowledge of what happens 
  in dogs and cats is limited.<br>
  Antiemetics are indicated for the control of intractable vomiting causing distress 
  to the animal or its owner. They are not necessary when the vomiting is intermittent 
  and fluid and electrolyte balance can easily be corrected. Antiemetics are symptomatic 
  treatments, and the underlying cause of the vomiting should be treated.</p>
<h2 id="ptz"></a>Phenothiazines</h2>
<p>Some of the most generally effective antiemetics are phenothiazines such as 
  <strong>prochlorperazine</strong> which act as dopamine D2 antagonists in the 
  vomiting centre and the chemoreceptor trigger zone, although they also have 
  weak anticholinergic activity and a variety of other effects. Because of their 
  inhibition of all the CNS centres involved in vomiting the phenothiazines are 
  effective antiemetics for most causes of vomiting. Their antiemetic effects 
  occur at drug concentrations much lower than necessary to produce sedation, 
  but sedation is often seen in practice, probably because of changes in the volume 
  of distribution in dehydrated animals. They must be used with caution in dehydrated 
  patients because they are a1 adrenergic receptor blockers, and can cause or 
  aggravate hypotension. In general, the antiemetic properties (and side effects) 
  of phenothiazines are dose related. If control of vomiting is not achieved at 
  low doses, the dose can be judiciously increased until a beneficial effect is 
  observed or significant side effects (usually hypotension) are seen. <strong>Acepromazine</strong> 
  is much less effective than prochlorperazine.</p>
<h2 id="antihist"></a>Antihistamines</h2>
<p>Antihistamines, such as <strong>diphenhydramine</strong>, <strong>cyclizine</strong> 
  and <strong>meclozine</strong> primarily inhibit vomiting by blocking H1 receptors 
  in the vestibular apparatus and, to a lesser extent, the chemoreceptor trigger 
  zone. They can be very effective in people, but less so in animals. They are 
  mainly used in the treatment of vomiting from motion sickness in dogs. Cats 
  are more resistant to their effects.</p>
<h2 id="dopAg"></a>Dopamine antagonists</h2>
<p><strong>Metoclopramide</strong> (when used as an antiemetic) and <strong>droperidol</strong> 
  primarily act as D2 antagonists at the chemoreceptor trigger zone and inhibit 
  vomiting due to blood borne emetic agents such as bacterial or uraemic toxins. 
  Metaclopramide also promotes gastric emptying (see below), probably by acting 
  as a 5HT<sub>4</sub> agonist, which adds to its antiemetic effect. In slightly 
  higher doses it is also a 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, which also potentiates 
  the antiemetic effects. Droperidol is a very potent D2 antagonist at much lower 
  doses than required to produce sedation , but can produce a variety of side 
  effects. Vomiting due to delayed gastric emptying may respond to these or to 
  prokinetic drugs such as cisapride (a 5HT<sub>4</sub> agonist). They may have 
  some sedative effect. <strong>Domperidone</strong> (D2 antagonist) is used in 
  people, but rarely in animals. It does not cross the blood brain barrier (although 
  it has an effect on the CTZ) so the CNS side effects of the other D2 antagonists 
  are not seen. Anticholinergic drugs<br>
  These are rarely effective as antiemetics unless vomiting is initiated by contraction 
  or spasm of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, when they will occasionally 
  be able to relieve the spasm and reduce the stimulus to vomit. Anticholinergic 
  drugs do not prevent the vomiting caused by stimulation of peripheral receptors 
  or by inflammation. Since these drugs reduce gastrointestinal motility, they 
  may actually be contraindicated in vomiting because they may exacerbate the 
  hypomotility of the gastric body. Hyoscine is occasionally helpful in motion 
  sickness in dogs and cats.</p>
<h2 id="5HT"></a>5HT<sub>3</sub> blockers</h2>
<p><strong>Ondansetron</strong> and <strong>tropisetron</strong> are used in people, 
  particularly for vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Destruction of 
  gut epithelium by the anticancer drugs causes the release of 5HT from chromaffin 
  cells in the afferent pathways; 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists block these 
  pathways. These drugs have not been used much in animals because of expense, 
  although they have been shown to be effective in dogs and cats.</p>
<h2 id="oth"></a>Other antiemetics</h2>
<p>If vomiting is caused by excitement, sedatives such as <strong>diazepam</strong> 
  can be effective, although <strong>acepromazine</strong> may be better as it 
  is a D2 antagonist as well. Cannabinoids have an antiemetic effect: in the UK, 
  <strong>nabilone</strong>, a D9 tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, is sometimes 
  used in people. It is very expensive. &#945;<sub>2</sub> antagonists (<strong>yohimbine</strong>, 
  <strong>atipamezole</strong>) may be useful in the cat although they are not 
  often used as antiemetics. <strong>Buspirone</strong>, an anxiolytic, may also 
  be useful in cats as a 5HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist in the vomiting centre.<br>
  <strong>Corticosteroids</strong> are sometimes used in people, particularly 
  in combinations to treat cancer chemotherapy induced emesis. Thier mechanism 
  of action is unknown, and in view of their side effects, they are probably best 
  avoided in animals.</p>
<h2 id="emetics"></a>Emetics</h2>
<p>It is occasionally necessary to make an animal vomit, usually as part of decontamination 
  in suspected poisoning cases. Emetics should not be used unless the animal is 
  fully conscious and there is no risk of it inhaling vomit.<br>
  <strong>Apomorphine</strong>, a dopamine agonist with a similar structure to 
  morphine, is the most reliable emetic. The most convenient way of using it is 
  to put a tablet under the eyelid and when the animal starts vomiting to remove 
  the tablet. Injections can cause prolonged vomiting and should be avoided. Morphine 
  itself usually causes vomiting in dogs, except when they are in pain. This is 
  probably a balance between its antiemetic effects on the cortex (either direct 
  or indirect) and its emetic efects on the CTZ. <strong>Xylazine</strong> will 
  cause vomiting in about 25% of dogs and 30 - 50% of cats if given iv at 200&micro;g/kg. 
  Saturated <strong>salt</strong> solutions, <strong>sodium carbonate</strong> 
  solutions (or a single crystal placed in the pharynx) and <strong>mustard</strong> 
  solutions given orally can also be used in an emergency but are not recommended. 
  <strong>Ipecacuanha</strong> is a general sales medicine used in children which 
  is also effective in animals, particularly in cats. However, overdose can cause 
  serious side effects, including death. </p>
