<h1>Purines</h1>
<p>The nomenclature is illogical and confusing and hopefully will be changed soon. 
  This note is meant for guidance; do not try to learn it. Adenosine, ADP and 
  ATP can all act as neurotransmitters / modulators, as well as having their better 
  known metabolic effects. </p>
<p>Adenosine acts on a series of G protein coupled receptors: on A1 receptors 
  to reduce adenylyl cyclase activity, on A2a and A2b receptors to increase adenylyl 
  cyclase activity, and on A3 receptors to reduce adenylyl cyclase activity. Other 
  receptor subtypes have been found in dogs' hearts. Xanthines (A1 and A2 antagonists) 
  are the only drugs of veterinary relevance at the moment, although adenosine 
  itself is sometimes used as an antiarrhythmic and vasodilator (A1). A2 receptors 
  may be involved in pain and anxiety; there will probably be specific agonists 
  and antagonists soon.</p>
<p>ADP and ATP act on P2 receptors. ATP released with noradrenaline from sympathatic 
  varicosities acts on P2X ionotropic receptors, of which there are at least 7 
  subtypes. These receptors are also widely distributed in the CNS as well as 
  on smooth muscle. The other P2 receptors are coupled to G proteins: P2Y receptor 
  activation leads to increased phospholipase C and reduced adenylyl cyclase activity: 
  there are probably many subtypes of this receptor as the range of effects is 
  very large. ATP acting at P2U receptors mediates some aspects of inflammation. 
  P2T receptors occur on platelets; ADP is an agonist, causing aggregation, ATP 
  is an antagonist. ATP can also produce a non selective increase in cell permeability 
  by acting at P2Z receptors. There are several other receptors which are probably 
  also P2 recptor subtypes. Confusing, isn't it?</p>
