<h1>Coughing</h1>
<p>A wide variety of drugs are used to treat conditions characterised by coughing. 
  A recent meta-analysis of these drugs in people concluded that there is no evidence 
  that they do any good (BMJ 2002, 324, 329). They are still widely used in all 
  species, however.</p>

<h2><a name="exp"></a>Expectorants / mucokinetic agents</h2>
<p>Healthy cilia, adequate volumes of respiratory tract secretions, and a functional 
  cough are all necessary to effectively clear airway mucus; however, many diseases, 
  eg, tracheobronchitis, bronchopneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
  disturb these functions and promote retention and drying of mucus. Many drugs 
  can alter the consistency and rheological behaviour of airway mucus, but often 
  only at higher than recommended doses. The clinical usefulness of mucokinetic 
  agents remains dubious mainly because there are no reliable methods to quantify 
  and evaluate their effects. Nevertheless, expectorants are almost always included 
  as ingredients in cough medicines and are frequently used to treat respiratory 
  disorders in large animals.<br>
  Tracheobronchial secretions can be modified and mobilized by increasing the 
  sol (colloid solution) layer, the hydration of mucus, and the motility of cilia, 
  and by decreasing the amount and viscosity of mucus. These effects can be achieved 
  by direct local action on the tracheobronchial epithelial cells and the submucosal 
  tubuloacinar glands, or by reflex action mediated by autonomic (especially vagal) 
  pathways. Expectorant or mucokinetic agents are administered orally, parenterally, 
  or by inhalation (vaporization or nebulization).</p>
<p><a name="dil"></a><strong>Mucokinetic Diluents</strong> </p>
<p>These substances dilute airway mucus after aerosol or systemic administration. 
  Dehydration is common in animals with lung disease because of diminished water 
  intake and excessive insensible water loss associated with pyrexia and hyperpnoea. 
  In this state, it is difficult to evacuate airway secretions. Thus, rehydration 
  is essential for effective expectorant therapy. Water and saline solutions are 
  the practical mucokinetic diluents used to liquefy hyper viscous mucus; oral 
  rehydration, administration of parenteral fluids, and inhalation of water vapour 
  (vaporization or &quot;steaming&quot;) or saline aerosols (nebulization) are 
  the approaches used. Diluents also serve as convenient carrier vehicles in aerosol 
  therapy. Several surface active agents, with a mode of action closely related 
  to that of diluents, are also used to facilitate hydration, emulsification, 
  and liquefaction of adhesive bronchial secretions. Commonly used surface active 
  agents are propylene glycol (2-5%), sodium bicarbonate (2-5%), and glycerine 
  (5%). These agents may be administered by mucosae or, at lower concentrations, 
  instilled directly into the respiratory tract.</p>
<p><a name="bmt"></a><strong>Bronchomucotropic Expectorants</strong></p>
<p>These drugs increase the volume and fluidity of secretions from the airway 
  mucosa by mechanisms that are not completely understood. They probably stimulate 
  the gastro-pulmonary vagal reflex, the vagal centre, terminal cholinergic fibres, 
  or the submucosal glands directly. Many of the traditional expectorants are 
  volatile oils or their derivatives, and resin containing balsams. These agents 
  probably stimulate the tracheobronchial glands directly and produce an associated 
  active hyperemia in the respiratory tree. The most frequently encountered compounds 
  found in various cough remedies include oil of eucalyptus, oil of pine, camphor, 
  menthol, benzoin, and terpin hydrate. These compounds may be dosed po but are 
  usually employed in vaporizers for inhalation. Essential oils are potentially 
  toxic. They tend to produce gastrointestinal and urinary tract irritation.</p>
<p><a name="sec"></a><strong>Secretory Expectorants</strong></p>
<p>Several inorganic and organic salts (saline expectorants) seem to stimulate 
  the gastro pulmonary vagal reflex with subsequent activation of the submucosal 
  bronchial glands. With iodide salts, direct stimulation occurs because iodides 
  concentrate in the glands. The most frequently used saline expectorants are 
  iodides, ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, ammonium chloride and carbonate, and 
  sodium and potassium nitrate. The main adverse effects to be avoided with saline 
  expectorants are iodinism with prolonged use of the iodides, and acute hyperammonaemia 
  with ammonium salts in animals with hepatic insufficiency.<br>
  A number of substances of plant origin that produce nausea and emesis at higher 
  doses are occasionally used at lower levels to stimulate the vagus to produce 
  reflex secretion by the tracheobronchial glands. These agents are found mostly 
  in proprietary cough mixtures. Examples are ipecac, squill, balsam of tolu, 
  and cocillana.<br>
  Glyceryl guaiacolate (guaiphenesin), a derivative of guaiacol obtained from 
  creosote, is a common secretory expectorant in cough medications. It is active 
  as a centrally acting muscle relaxant and sedative when administered iv. Carbon 
  dioxide and certain sulphonamides also act as secretory expectorants.</p>
<p><a name="mlx"></a><strong>Mucolytic Expectorants</strong></p>
<p>Mucolytics are substances that interfere with the structural integrity (and 
  thus alter the viscosity) of the constituents in mucoid or purulent airway secretions, 
  which favors airway clearance by cilia. Depolymerization of glycoprotein molecules 
  or hydrolysis of protein or nucleoprotein strands are the usual mechanisms involved.<br>
  Acetylcysteine and carbocysteine are mucolytic agents that are administered 
  as aerosols or intratracheally. Side effects include bronchospasm, ciliary inhibition, 
  severe coughing, and its propensity to inactivate antibiotics, particularly 
  penicillins.<br>
  Bromhexine is a similar drug which also results in an increase in immunoglobulin 
  levels in airway secretions. It may be administered either po or parenterally 
  and has been used as ancillary therapy in the management of bronchopneumonia 
  in horses, cattle, and pigs, as well as for the treatment of amniotic fluid 
  aspiration in newborn calves and piglets.<br>
  Dembrixine enhances serous glandular secretions and diminishes the viscosity 
  of tracheobronchial mucus.<br>
  Several types of enzymes have been administered by inhalation or instillation 
  into the bronchi to dissolve components of mucopurulent bronchial secretions. 
  Included among these preparations are deoxyribonuclease, streptokinase, streptodornase, 
  and trypsin. The response to these medications remains equivocal, and side effects, 
  including airway irritation, are not uncommon.<br>
  In general, mucolytic expectorants are not much use since their effects do not 
  assist clearance of the respiratory secretions except when the mucociliary escalator 
  is intact and functioning. Most disease which results in inspissation of respiratory 
  secretions coincidentally compromises the airway clearing mechanisms. Therefore, 
  mucolytic expectorants result in a gravitational pooling of respiratory secretions 
  within the small airways, beyond the reach of effective coughing.</p>
<h2><a name="cilia"></a>Cilia augmentors</h2>
<p>These are substances that increase, directly or indirectly, the beat frequency 
  of airway cilia. The precise mechanisms involved remain unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Expectorants</strong></p>
<p>Potassium iodide and ammonium chloride are probably the most effective.</p>
<p><strong>Adrenergic agents </strong></p>
<p>Adrenergic b2 agonists are the most effective cilia augmentors. Examples include 
  salbutamol, terbutaline, fenoterol, and clenbuterol.</p>
<p><strong>Methylxanthines</strong></p>
<p>Theophylline and aminophylline, in addition to their ability to relax smooth 
  muscle of airways also increase the beat frequency of cilia.</p>
<p><strong>Cholinergic agents </strong></p>
<p>Neostigmine directly stimulates ciliary activity and bronchial secretions, 
  but its airway-constricting effects preclude itstherapeutic use for this purpose.</p>
<h2><a name="antituss"></a>Antitussives</h2>
<p>These reduce coughing, and are indicated only when coughing is painful, unproductive, 
  distressing, exhausting, or likely to exacerbate lung damage. They should not 
  be used in the presence of productive coughs since this would allow the collection 
  of fluids. They should never be employed symptomatically in the absence of a 
  diagnosis since indiscriminate inhibition of the coughing reflex could have 
  disastrous consequences. This group of drugs acts by interfering with the cough 
  reflex, either at the sensory receptors in the pharynx or larynx or by inhibition 
  of the cough centre in the medulla.</p>
<p>Demulcents, such as glycerine, syrup, or honey, which coat and soothe inflamed 
  mucosae are used in man (rarely of much use in animals).<br>
  <a href="../CNSfiles/CNSlocal.html">Local anaesthetics</a> (e.g. lignocaine) 
  that block sensory impulses from the pharynx and larynx. Benzonatate acts both 
  peripherally and centrally.<br>
  Since one of the primary stimuli for coughing is bronchoconstriction, bronchodilators 
  are frequently the most useful drugs in control of coughing (see below).<br>
  <a href="../CNSfiles/CNSop-index.html">Opioids</a> are potent inhibitors of 
  the medullary cough centre at subanalgesic doses and are used specifically as 
  antitussives, particularly codeine (short acting) and butorphanol (long acting). 
  Other drugs usually seen in &#8220;cold cures&#8221; include: dextromethorphan 
  , pholcodine, benzonatate, and noscapine (tends to result in histamine release 
  in dogs).<br>
  Opioid antitussives tend to produce sedative effects, respiratory depression, 
  occasional vomiting, and constipation with continued use.</p>
