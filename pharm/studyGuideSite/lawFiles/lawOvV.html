		<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The situation is confused at present. A new law, the <strong>Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act (1997)</strong> (ACVM Act) started to come into effect in July 2001, and is supposed to have been fully implemented by July 2004. This says that everyting sold for use in animals must be registered (with a few exceptions) and conditions are imposed on registration, which can cover use among other things. This Act is supposed to fit in with the <strong>Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act (1996)</strong> (HSNO Act) and the <strong>Biosecurity Act (1993)</strong> so that everything to do with agriculture is covered by these Acts. This may have sounded like a good idea over a beer in the Backbencher's Bar, but it appears that very little thought went into the details. In particular, none of the politicians seems to have realised that veterinary medicines are given to small animals as well as farm animals, and that human medicines are given to both. The <strong>Animal Produce Act (1999)</strong> requires standards for foods to be contained in separate regulations, but at present, MRLs are covered by <strong>New Zealand (Maximum Residue Limits of Agricultural Compounds) Food Standards (2010)</strong> made under the <strong>Food Act (1981)</strong>. However, where these are different to EU MRLs, the EU MRLs are used for veterinary medicines! Everything to to with food is supposed to be administered by the NZ Food Safety Authority, which has recently been hived off from MAF, and reports to the Minister of Health. The ACVM Act is administered by the NZFSA, which shows clearly where their priorities lie. Confused? So is every vet in NZ, but ignorance of the law is not a defence for breaking it (in most cases - that is not very clear either).</p>
<p>The ACVM Act, while full of flaws, is relatively straightforward compared to the HSNO Act. Since all veterinary medicines fit into the category of hazardous substances (human medicines do too, but they have been given an exemption), they are supposed to be registered under the HSNO Act. This involves public consultation, which can be mind-bogglingly expensive. This is likely to mean that there will be very few new veterinary medicines registered. The status of the large volumes of human medicines used in animals does not appear to have been considered, but this volume is likely to increase as the price differential caused by double registration of veterinary medicines increases.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while people try to get to grips with the new law, things carry on much as they did under the <strong>Animal Remedies Act (1967)</strong>. This is similar to veterinary medicines legislation in many other countries, where everything to do with veterinary medicines is contained in one Act. Drug companies are familiar with this sort of legislation and there was a rush to get drugs licensed under the old system before July 2001. There have been very few applications to register new drugs since, which may only be temporary.</p>
<p>The Animal Remedies Act was one of the first main pieces of animal medicines legislation in the world and had to be extensively modified over the years. The <strong>Medicines Act (1981)</strong> only deals with human medicines, but veterinary surgeons using human medicines in animals must stick by its provisions. There was a rash of medicines legislation around the world following the thalidomide affair in the late 1950s; by waiting and basing its legislation on what was done elsewhere, NZ got it right first time. There are significant differences from the Animal Remedies and ACVM Acts.</p>
<p>The <strong>Misuse of Drugs Act (1975)</strong> is designed to stop people abusing addictive drugs. It contains a number of sensible provisions which increase the burden of paperwork. Most countries have similar legislation.</p>
<p>Both these Acts are under review as part of a harmonisation process with Australia (but don't hold your breath). There is tighter control of discretionary use of drugs there, so expect the worst.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dairy Industry Regs (1990)</strong> made under the <strong>Dairy Industry Act (1952)</strong> require farmers to follow Product Safety Programmes to ensure that contaminated milk does not enter the supply chain. MAF Standard D105 “Milking Animal Health” requires farmers to keep records of drugs given to their animals. This information usually comes from vets, on a standard form (<a href="http://www.vets.org.nz/Vetzone/Forms/infoforms.htm">treatment form 2</a>).</p>
