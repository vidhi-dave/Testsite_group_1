	<h1>Acts of Parliament</h1>
	
	<h2 id="ara">Animal Remedies Act (1967)</h2>
		<p>This has now been repealed, but you still need to have an idea of its provisions.</p>
		<p>It defined an animal remedy, made it illegal to sell an unregistered animal remedy, established the Animal Remedies Board which had control of drug registration and use. Drugs had to be safe and effective to be registered, and the ARB could refuse registration or impose conditions on use to take into account public health and environmental issues.</p>
		<p>Most vets assume that the ACVM Act must be similar, but it is not.</p>
		<h3>Classification of Animal Remedies</h3>
		<p><strong>Class I prescription animal remedy</strong> (PAR): may be administered to an animal only by a
		<ul>
			<li>veterinary surgeon</li>
			<li>under and in accordance with authority or prescription of veterinary surgeon.</li></ul></p>
		<p><strong>Class II PAR</strong>: administered only by a
		<ul>
			<li>veterinary surgeon or</li>
			<li>in the presence and under the direct control of a veterinary surgeon.</li></ul></p>
		<p><strong>Class III PAR</strong>: administered only by a veterinary surgeon</p>
		<p>(Pethidine, carfentanil and fentanyl containing preparations are the only drugs in this category.)</p>
		<p>Other drugs can be purchased without a prescription, sometimes called over the counter drugs (OTC).</p>
		<p>This classification has continued under the ACVM Act. The term &ldquo;prescription animal remedy&rdquo; was retained since the ACVM Act defines the more sensible term &ldquo;veterinary medicine&rdquo; in such a silly way.</p>
		<p>Note that the Animal Remedies Act covered all aspects of veterinary medicines (including public health and environmental issues) in contrast to the ACVM Act.</p>
		
	<h2 id="acvm">Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act (1997)</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1997/0087/latest/DLM414577.html?search=ts_act_medicines_resel&p=1">full text</a></p>
		<p>&ldquo;Veterinary Medicine&rdquo; is defined as anything used in the direct management of animals, and this wide definition has caused problems. NZFSA have gradually reduced the working definition to something sensible. Tractors and sheds are now excluded (although the position of stockmen is unclear), and the idea of registering hypodermic needles and surgical instruments has been dropped. Grass is a veterinary medicine, although it is generally recognised as safe (GRAS in ACVMspeak). To get round this problem, NZFSA are again referring to what the rest of the world knows as &ldquo;veterinary medicines&rdquo; as &ldquo;animal remedies&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>The ACVM Act is designed to manage specific risks: <strong>trade in primary produce</strong>, <strong>agricultural security</strong> and <strong>animal welfare</strong>. Domestic food standards are mentioned as an afterthought. Benefits such as efficacy are not considered unless they affect animal welfare (you are supposed to sue the manufacturer under consumer legislation if the drug does not work). Safety is the same. Inaccurate labelling (exaggerated claims) is also a matter for the Fair Trading Act (1986).</p>
		<p>Under the ACVM Act, the Animal Remedies Board (which controlled drug registration and use) has been abolished and drug registration is now subject to political control.</p>
		<p>It is illegal to use drugs in animals which are not registered with MAF or specifically exempted from registration (either with or without conditions). To comply with international treaties, it is likely that nearly all drugs for use in food animals will have to be registered (eg antibiotics). Registration can involve conditions on use. Drugs which pose a low risk will be exempted (eg hoof treatments, oxygen, shampoos, human over the counter medicines). Many drugs for small animals are fall into the &ldquo;exempted with conditions&rdquo; category, in most cases, the conditions will be that a code of practice is followed, although in some cases the conditions may be related to the manufacturing process, or packaging and labelling, and will not directly affect vets. The relevant code of practice for vets will usually be the <strong>NZVA Code of Practice for the Discretionary Use of Human and Veterinary Medicines by Registered Veterinarians</strong> (more on this <a href="lawDiscr.html">below</a>).</p>
		<p>Horses will be treated as companion animals, provided a long withholding period (6 months) is observed.</p>
		<p>The PAR classification persists but has been modified and remodified back again several times. Another major modification is in the wind. Nearly all antibiotics are PAR1s and were subdivided into six categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Level 1 - no controls (not PAR)</li>
			<li>Level 2 - PAR1 but use for growth promotion banned (similar to current PAR1)</li>
			<li>Level 3 - PAR1 for serious infections when culture and sensitivity has shown nothing else is likely to work</li>
			<li>Level 4 - as level 3 but MAF must be notified of every use</li>
			<li>Level 5 - banned in food animals
			<li>Level 6 - banned in <strong>all </strong>animals</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This was a sensible system, proving drugs were put into the right classes. This system was imposed as conditions on registration. The ACVM Group periodically decides that this is too simple and that every individual antibiotic will have different conditions on registration. Even the drug companies cannot keep up with this vacillation and most antibiotics now have something on the label like &ldquo;See the ACVM website for conditions&rdquo;. These conditions are compulsory but are usually totally unknown to vets in practice.</p>
		<p>The latest proposal is to rename the classes:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>unrestricted</strong> = OTC</li>
				<li><strong>restricted class A</strong> = PAR1</li>
				<li><strong>restricted class B</strong> = PAR3</li>
				<li><strong>restricted class C</strong> = a means of allowing corporate farmers to use prescription veterinary medicines without veterinary interference in their money making</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>How long this will last is anyone's guess.</p>
		<p>The NZFSA has also separated prescribing from trading in veterinary medicines, which allows anyone with a trader's licence to fill prescriptions written by a vet. Vets have to register as traders, but are not subject to some of the vetting that others are.</p>
		<p>One of the big problems with the ACVM Act is that since the Act itself contains so little useful information, the civil servants in the ACVM Group of the NZFSA have had to make up the rules as they go along. It can be very difficult to determine what is actual law and what is only ACVM Group policy.</p>
		<p>The NZVA have published their summary of the ACVM Act in their <a href="http://www.vets.org.nz/Vetzone/Forms/infoforms.htm">Guide to Veterinary Pharmacy and Dispensing</a>, which all vets should read: </p>
		<h3>Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Regs (2001/101)</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2001/0101/latest/DLM27750.html?search=ts_regulation_agricultural_resel&p=1">full text</a></p>
		<p>These list the &ldquo;veterinary medicines&rdquo; which are exempt from registration under the ACVM Act (medicines made up for use on someone&apos;s own animals, medical gases, hoof and skin perparations, etc, etc), and specify the conditions for those which are exempt with conditions (homoeopathic preparations, herbal medicines, antiseptics, human medicines and medicines compounded by vets).</p>
		<p>The regs also include a list of banned poisonous plants, and a list of substances generally recognised as safe. There are also specifications for labels.</p>
		<h3>Schedule 8</h3>
		<p>A list of banned drugs; mostly things like DDT and strychnine, which have not been used for years. However, like the rest of this legislation, it is badly written. Many of the drugs are acronyms: it is not clear if DDD stands for &ldquo;Donald Duck Drug&rdquo; or is a synonym for <a href="../InfHoFiles/infHoSterCush.html#drugs">mitotane.</a></p>
		
		<h2 id="hsno">Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act (1996)</h2>
		<p>As the name suggests, this is designed to regulate hazardous substances (environmental and human effects) and new organisms (anything not already present in NZ). It established the Environmental Risk Management Agency (ERMA) which spent a long time bogged down in trying to regulate genetically engineered organisms. All veterinary medicines have to be registered under this act too, but the hazardous substances part is mind-bogglingly complicated and has been amended many times so far. On the day the Act was passed, someone realised that it would be illegal to fill a car up with petrol, so the first amendment was rushed through. This process continues.</p>
		<p>The HSNO Act is different from other Acts by registering generic substances: thus if a company spends megabucks registering their new drug, other companies can freeload on this registration once the patent runs out. Understandably, this does not encourage registration. A sensible compromise has emerged, where ERMA delegates registration of low risk compounds to more appropriate people, such as the ACVM Group of the NZFSA.</p>
		<p>Vets are deemed to be &ldquo;approved handlers&rdquo; for some drugs but need specific licences for others, or large quantities of them.</p>
		<p>ERMA regards drugs with potential environmental effects, such as avermectins, as high risk. It is not out of the question that drenches will have the same restrictions as nuclear waste!</p>
		<p>Masochists with plenty of time on their hands should consult the <a href="http://www.ermanz.govt.nz/hs/transfer-veterinary-medicines.asp">ERMA website</a>.</p>
		<p>This Act has the potential to cause complete chaos; if it was enforced as it is, all industry in NZ would stop. Most vets ignore it and hope it will all go away: it will not.</p>
		
		<h2 id="med">Medicines Act (1981)</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0118/latest/DLM53790.html?search=ts_act_medicines_resel&p=1">full text</a></p>
		<h3>Medicines Regulations (1984/143)</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1984/0143/latest/DLM95668.html?search=ts_regulation_medicines_resel&p=1">full text</a></p>
		<p>Regulates the manufacture, supply and use of human medicines. Drugs must be approved for sale, and must meet standards for purity, safety and efficacy. Covers prescriptions, labelling and storage requirements (see below). Veterinary surgeons may prescribe and dispense drugs <strong>for animals under their care</strong>. Classifies drugs into &ldquo;Prescription only medicines&rdquo;, &ldquo;Restricted medicines&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pharmacy medicines&rdquo;, which are subject to different controls. Drugs not specifically classified are &ldquo;general sales medicines&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>Administered by Medsafe, who have an excellent <a href="http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs.htm">web site</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="mda">Misuse of Drugs Act (1975)</h2>
		<h3>Misuse of Drugs Regulations (1977/37)</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1977/0037/latest/DLM54840.html?search=ts_regulation_misuse_resel&p=1">full text</a></p>
		<p>This is the main legislation designed to control the use of addictive drugs. Classifies controlled drugs - mainly important for illegal possession. Vets are permitted to supply, prescribe and administer controlled drugs Class B or C for animals under their care. Specifies the more stringent requirements for prescriptions, labelling and storage of controlled drugs. Allows the Minister of Health to ban specific vets from prescribing controlled drugs, ensures that the Veterinary Council is informed of any convictions concerning controlled drugs so that convicts can be struck off.</p>
		<h3>Class A controlled drugs</h3>
		<p>Drugs of addiction such as LSD, heroin, cocaine, most amphetamines; drugs with no clinical use such as thalidomide (and Spanish fly!). The only drug of veterinary interest is etorphine. It is probably included here as it is highly dangerous to people. Permission from the Minister of Health is required to use Class A drugs. You should not come across these drugs in practice in NZ.</p>
		<h3>Class B controlled drugs:</h3>
		<p>Most opioids, including diphenoxylate (but also ecstasy and cannabis for some reason). In veterinary practice it is never necessary to prescribe or dispense Class B drugs: they should be kept in the clinic and administered to the animal as needed.</p>
		<h3>Class C controlled drugs</h3>
		<p>Codeine, barbiturates, buprenorphine, meprobamate; very dilute solutions of morphine, &lt; 2.5mg diphenoxylate (also cannabis plant and coco leaf!) Benzodiazepines, which are the class of drugs most widely abused by people, have recently been added to class C. &ldquo;Designer drugs&rdquo; (analogues of drugs of abuse) are in class C 7. This includes carfentanil (!?).Some drugs commonly used in small animal practice such as pseudoephedrine (used illegally to make methamphetamine) are likely to be made class C soon.</p>
		<p>Ketamine has recently been added to Class C.</p>
		<p>A list of controlled drug precursors has recently been added. There are no controls on these yet but controls could be easily added at any time. Beware!</p>
