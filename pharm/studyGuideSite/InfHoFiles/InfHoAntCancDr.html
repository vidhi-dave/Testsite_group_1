  <h1>Drugs</h1>
  <p>Anticancer drugs are usually divided into several different groups:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>antimetabolites</li>
    <li>alkylating agents</li>
    <li>anticancer antibiotics</li>
    <li>microtubule inhibitors</li>
    <li>odds &amp; sods</li>
    <li>hormones</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="choose">Choosing drugs</h2>
  <p>The range of tumours which animals can get is vast; most of the few which are treated, are treated empirically. Protocols (based on human protocols, which are also empirical but of which there is much more experience) have been established for some tumours (particularly white cell tumours), but often it is a matter of trying drugs or protocols which have been reported to work in a small number of cases and tailoring the treatment to the response.</p>
  <h3 id="alk">Alkylating agents</h3>
  <img src="images/alk-agents-col.gif">
    <p>Alkylating agents are probably the most commonly used group of drugs in small animals. They include cyclophosphamide - a prodrug for one of the nitrogen mustards. These are closely related to the sulphur mustard gases used for chemical warfare in WW1. Cyclophosphamide is not a pleasant drug. Although it is cheaper than some of the other drugs and works well in some lymphomas and leukaemias, a metabolite can cause haemorrhagic cystitis (as well as all the general side effects of cytotoxic drugs). A similar drug without this effect is chlorambucil (similar indications). Both drugs are sometimes used as potent immunosuppressives. The other alkylating drug occasionally used is melphalan. Cisplatin, and its less toxic analogue carboplatin, act in a similar way to the alkylating agents and are used for a variety of solid tumours. Cisplatin in particular is nephrotoxic and should not be used in cats (carboplatin can be used in cats).</p>
    <h3 id="antimet">Antimetabolites</h3>
    <p>The main antimetabolites used are methotrexate (used for lymphoma) and cytarabine (= cytosine arabinoside) (used for lymphoma, leukaemia and myeloproliferative disease). Resistance develops quickly to cytarabine.</p>
    <h3 id="abs">Antibiotics</h3>
    <p>A number of antibiotics are in human use but the only one much used in animals is doxorubicin (Adriamycin). This is effective in a broad range of cancers and is used for carinomas and sarcomas as well as lymphoma and leukaemias. It has a broad spectrum of side effects too, including cardiotoxicity, allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity (cats). It is also very irritant when injected perivascularly.</p>
    <h3 id="plAlkd">Plant alkaloids</h3>
    <p>Plant alkaloids are a growth area for human drugs but the only ones in veterinary use are vincristine and vinblastine (originally from the periwinkle, <em>Vinca rosea</em>). Vincristine in particular is not as myelosuppressive as most drugs, although it does produce some unique side effects such as peripheral neuropathies. Both are used in combinations (usually with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) for lymphmomas and some sarcomas and are very irritant perivascularly. Taxanes such as paclitaxel (Taxol) are effective in people but are too expensive for use in animals at the moment.</p>
    <h3 id="asp">Asparaginase</h3>
    <p>Miscellaneous cytotoxic drugs include crisantaspase and colaspase - types of asparaginase. Some tumour cells require exogenous asparagine, asparaginase breaks this down and stops the tumour cells making protein. It is used for lymphoma but can cause anaphylaxis and is expensive.</p>
    <h3 id="sex">Sex hormones</h3>
    <p>Many tumours are started or maintained by <a href="infHoSxHorm.html">sex hormones</a>. In veterinary practice, these are usually treated by castration (prostate cancer, anal adenoma) or spaying (mammary tumours). In people, and rarely in animals, drugs are used. Tamoxifen is an antioestrogen used for breast cancer in women which is also effective in dogs but too expensive to use. Anastrozole blocks oestrogen production and is more effective in women. Delmadinone is a progestagen which acts as an antiandrogen and is sometimes used in dogs. Stilboestrol used to be used as an antiandrogen, but is no longer available.</p>
    <h3 id="oth">Other drugs</h3>
    <p>In human cancers, the current trend is to target receptors only or mainly possessed by cancer cells. In one tumour - mast cell tumour in dogs - this approach is also used. Specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as masitinib or toceranib, which block the c-kit receptor, can be very effective.</p>
  <h2 id="risks">Risks to people</h2>
  <p>Paradoxically, repeated exposure of people to low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs can predispose them to neoplasia. In addition, chemotherapeutic drugs are teratogenic and toxic. Exposure can occur via absorption through skin or mucous membranes, inhalation of vapours or ingestion through contamination of food or cigarettes.</p>
    <p>Common situations in which exposure occurs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>aerosol formation when reconstituting or removing liquid drugs from a pressurized vial</li>
    <li>expulsion of air from drug-filled syringes</li>
    <li>spills during transfer of drug between containers</li>
    <li>leakage of catheters, iv lines or bags</li>
    <li>self-inoculation when recapping needles</li>
        <li>crushing or breaking tablets</li>
    <li>handling urine or faeces from treated animals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Precautions required:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>wear latex gloves; +/-protective eyewear and a disposable gown when administering drugs or handling waste</li>
    <li>pet owners should be instructed to wear gloves when administering tablets.</li>
    <li>prepare drugs in a low-traffic, draught-free but well ventilated area</li>
    <li>if possible wear a respirator or dust mask when preparing drugs (often more practical to buy the drugs reconstituted from a local hospital)</li>
    <li>avoid recapping needles or pressurizing vials</li>
    <li>wrap an alcohol-dampened swab around needles before withdrawing them from vials</li>
    <li>evacuate air bubbles from drug-filled syringes into alcohol-dampened gauze</li>
    <li>use disposable plastic-backed table covers to minimize contamination of tables with spilled drug</li>
    <li>never eat or drink in areas where cytotoxics are used</li>
    <li>consider altering oral drug dosing frequency to allow use of whole tablets rather than tablet fragments</li>
    <li>never allow pregnant women (including owners) to handle drugs or handle excreta from treated animals</li>
    <li>think very carefully (and discuss with the owner) before sending an animal home to a household with a pregnant woman or children</li>
    <li>be familiar with routes of excretion so that contaminated urine or faeces are safely disposed of. This is particularly important with the urine from cisplatin-treated dogs.</li>
    <li>if skin contact occurs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water</li>
    <li>all materials used in the injection of a chemotherapeutic should be placed in a plastic bag, sealed and then placed in a clearly labelled, leak-proof container for disposal by incineration.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2 id="notIV">Protocol to follow if a vesicating drug is injected outside the vein</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Do not remove needle but aspirate forcefully while needle remains in place.</li>
      <li>If doxorubicin has been extravasated immediately flood area with 5 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.</li>
      <li>Aspirate the area with a 25 SWG needle.</li>
      <li>Infiltrate affected area with small volumes of normal saline and repeat aspiration (use 3-5 mL with vincristine and 15-30 mL with doxorubicin).</li>
            <li>Infuse dexamethasone 4mg.</li>
      <li>Cold pack for 15 minutes</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Extravasation in people is extremely painful - consider analgesics. <strong>Prevention is better than cure - use a catheter.</strong><br>
  <h2 id="la">Large animals</h2>
  <p>The only tumours treated medically are sarcoids in horses. When these grow around the eyes it is difficult to resect them or use cryosurgery, so cisplatin in oil is sometimes injected into the tumours. It requires high pressure to inject oil into a solid tumour, so use Luer lock syringes and wear goggles.</p>
  <h2 id="future">The future??</h2>
  <p>The unsatisfactory state of chemotherapy (in people) has prompted a huge amount of research. This has taken several directions: new drugs are the most obvious. Lots of plants and sedentary animals such as sponges make toxins to stop themselves being completely eaten, so the jungles and seabeds are being scoured for suitable drug candidates. (Sponges are handy because they will grow in a stream of sea water - the drug just needs to be extracted at the other end of the pipe.) Expect some new drugs soon.<br>
    Another approach has been to target the cancer cells more directly, rather than zap all dividing cells. One way is to use some drug which is preferentially taken up by the cancer cells but requires activation by / sensitises the cells to radiotherapy (ideally relatively innocuous radiotherapy such as laser light). This approach is already in use in people. <br>
    Another way is to use biochemical markers which are more specific for cancer cells and attach the drug (either cytotoxic or activator) to antibodies for these markers. <br>
    Yet another way is to interfere with the tumour&rsquo;s blood supply and starve it to death. A rapidly growing tumour needs a rapidly growing blood supply - new vessels are under the control of various growth factors which can be blocked by drugs such as the anti-arthritis drug pentosan. Thalidomide is also being tried. The tumour&rsquo;s blood supply often does not keep up with demand and the tumour becomes hypoxic. Injecting anaerobic bacteria into such tumours to kill the hypoxic cells has shown some success.<br>
    New drugs are currently coming onto the market (overseas) at the rate of about one every six weeks, so do not regard this study guide as the last word on cancer chemotherapy!!!<br>
    Further down the line, insertion of tumour suppression genes looks hopeful if problems with the viral vectors are sorted out. A number of genes have been identified in people which predispose to cancer.<br>
    Cancer is the number one killer of humans, so there is plenty of incentive to find the definitive cure, quickly!</p>
