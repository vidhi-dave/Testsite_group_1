<h1>Other anti-arthritis drugs</p>
		<p>Extracts of green lipped mussels have some anti-inflammatory effects. This is probably produced by a large glycoprotein similar to the other anti-arthritis drugs, but it may also be caused by the copper in the mussel&rsquo;s blood. Many organic copper compounds have a mild anti-inflammatory effect, probably because copper is an essential part of the enzyme superoxide dismutase, which mops up superoxide ions before they can damage tissue. Copper has been a traditional treatment for arthritis in people and is now being sold for use in dogs. Published evidence of efficacy is lacking.<br>
			<br>
			A wide variety of other drugs are used in people to treat rheumatoid arthritis and are sometimes tried in dogs. These include penicillamine, chloroquine (also used as an antimalarial), sulphasalazine (see gut notes) and gold compounds (see immunosuppressive drugs). Tetracyclines (especially doxycycline) and nicotinamide are sometimes used as immunosupressants / anti-inflammatories in dogs. Their mechanism is unknown.<br>
			<br>
			Phosphodiesterase 4 is involved in inflammation, and its inhibitors can have a useful anti-inflammatory effect, but they also cause vomiting. They are being investigated for asthma in people. A variety of non specific PDE inhibitors are used in animals, which may have some anti-inflammatory effect. The most widely used non specific PDE4 inhibitor used in people is oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline USAN) and it is occasionally used in animals.<br>
			<br>
			There are many m opioid receptors on macrophages in inflammatory lesions for some reason, and opioids have an anti-inflammatory effect in these sites. Morphine is occasionally injected into joints after surgery as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory.<br>
			<br>
			Suramin, used to treat sleeping sickness in people, is an effective inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor, and has been used in people for this effect. It is a nasty drug and best avoided.</p>
		<h2>Antioxidants</h2>
		<p>Various free radicals, often superoxide ions, are released in inflammation. These are very effective at damaging cell membranes, releasing phospholipids and activating the arachidonic acid cascade. A variety of substances act as antioxidants, vitamin E and glutathione are common examples. Many plants produce compounds to mop up free radicals (they are produced during photosynthesis but also damage plant cells) so many herbal medicines have a mild antioxidant effect. Many also have NSAID compounds present which add to the effect. Plants also produce corticosteroids, and many &quot;antioxidant&quot; herbal medicines produce their anti-inflammatory effect through steroids, either natural or added during adulteration.</p>
		<h2>Essential fatty acids</h2>

		<p class="caption">The nomenclature of fatty acids is confusing. This structure is usually known as arachidonic acid (eicosatetraenoic acid, 20:4n-6). It has 20 carbon atoms and 4 double bonds which start from carbon 6.</p>
		<p>A variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from plants and sea fish have been used as dietary supplements. g-linolenic acid from evening primrose oil or borage oil is popular in dogs, as is oil from cold water fish (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) in people. These have an anti-inflammatory effect by being converted to abnormal prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which do not have such a pro-inflammatory effect. There are a large number of products of COX and 5-LOX which affect inflammation (and many other processes), and the optimal ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids to produce the optimal mixture is not known.</p>

		<p>The effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids is small, but can be clinically important, for instance in skin disease in dogs.</p>
