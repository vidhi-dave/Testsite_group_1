		<h1>Thyroid</h1>
		<p>Disorders of thyroid function are common in small animals; usually hypothyroidism in dogs and hyperthyroidism in cats. In large animals, the problems are usually external, either iodine deficiency or plant toxins which interfere with iodine utilisation (particularly plants of the <a href="../../toxSite/poisonplants/data/cabbage/cabbage.html">cabbage</a> family).</p>
		<h2 id="phys">Thyroid Physiology</h2>
		<p>The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin releasing hormone in response to environmental stessors such as cold or trauma. Thyrotropin releasing hormone acts on the anterior pituitary to increase the release of thyrotropin. This in turn stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones. Several of these steps can be manipulated with drugs but this is not done clinically.</p>
		<h3>Thyroid hormone production</h3>
		<img src="images/thyroid-col.gif">
		<p>The thyroid gland makes four times as much thyroxine (T4, levothyroxin INN) as liothyronine (T3, triiodothyronine) but T3 is four times as active as T4 in the tissue. T4 has more control over thyrotropin releasing hormone secretion.<br>
			<br>
			Thyroid hormones are highly protein bound in circulation. Free T4 makes up 0.1 - 0.3% of the total T4. Thyroxine-binding globulin is the major transport protein for both thyroid hormones.<br>
			<br>
			T4 has a half life of approximately 10-16 hours in the dog (nb the half life in man is much longer - about 6 days - beware if reading the human literature). It is converted to T3 or reverse T3 (rT3) by deiodinase enzymes. There are two types of enzyme - type 1 found in the liver, kidney, skin and muscle (highest activity in the liver and kidney) and type 2 found in the CNS and brown adipose tissue. T3 is quickly deiodinated, then broken down in the liver and excreted in the faeces (predominantly) or urine.</p>
		<h3 id="actions">Actions of thyroid hormones</h3>
		<p>T4 is converted to the active T3 in cells. T3 binds to a specific receptor similar to the steroid receptor. The T3/receptor complex activates transcription of a variety of proteins (the unbound receptor will reduce transcription). These proteins result in an increase in metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, and thus temperature, mainly by an increase in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Effects on the heart are most obvious - tachycardia and possibly arrhythmias. Thyroid hormones are also necessary for growth and maturity.</p>
		<h2 id="hypothyr">Hypothyroidism</h2>
		<p>This is the most common endocrinopathy in dogs; occuring in middle aged dogs of medium to large breeds, particularly Dobermanns. It is uncommonly diagnosed in cats - most often secondary to treatment for hyperthyroidism.</p>
		<h3>Causes</h3>
		<p>primary hypothyroidism - destruction of the thyroid gland by lymphocytic thyroiditis<br>
			-idiopathic follicular atrophy<br>
			-congenital - dyshormonogenesis, Iodine deficiency, thyroid dysgenesis<br>
			-iodine deficiency/excess<br>
			-destruction of gland by tumour / infection<br>
			-secondary hypothyroidism -eg pituitary tumour</p>
		<h3>Clinical signs of hypothyroidism</h3>
		<p>large range may be seen, including: <br>
			cold and exercise intolerance<br>
			bradycardia<br>
			hypothermia<br>
			depression / lethargy<br>
			symmetrical alopecia, hyperpigmentation, lightening of the coat colour, &quot;rat tail', but sometimes increased thickness of the coat, recurrent pyoderma<br>
			polyneuropathy<br>
			polymyopathy<br>
			anaemia<br>
			reproductive failure</p>
		<h3>Drugs</h3>
		<p>The aim of treatment is to approximate the secretion of thyroid hormones in a normal dog. Levothyroxine is the treatment of choice as it mimics the normal physiological situation. It is rapidly converted to T3 and has a half life of 10-16 hours, but the biological effect lasts longer than this - it is usually given once daily. The peak plasma concentration is reached in 4-12 hours. It is cheap.<br>
			<br>
			Synthetic liothyronine is also available. It has a short half life (5 - 6 hours) so needs to be administered every 8 hours, therefore is not often used. It is only given if a T4 to T3 conversion defect is diagnosed or if thyroxine is poorly absorbed, but neither of these conditions has been reported in dogs. Some tissues rely on circulating T3 for their source of intracellular T3, so when T3 is given you can get hyperthyroid signs in the heart, but the brain may be euthyroid or hypothyroid. Peak plasma levels occur 2-5 hours after administration.<br>

		<h3>Dose</h3>
		<p>Start with a low dose, particularly if there is cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus or hypoadrenocorticism. It was usual to start with a moderate dose for three months and then decrease, but recent work shows that this is unnecessary. Hypoadrenocorticoid animals will need supplementary cortisol due to increased metabolic demands by the increased T4.<br>
			<br>
			Reduce dose in liver or renal failure.<br>
			<br>
			Higher doses more often are necessary in dogs than humans, as the bioavailability of T4 is low due to poor absorption and the first pass effect.</p>
		<h3>Monitoring</h3>
		<p>Resolution of clinical signs: mental state/alertness should improve in 1-3 weeks; skin and weight improve in weeks to months.<br>
			<br>
			Absorption and pharmacokinetics vary between animals so therapeutic drug monitoring may be necessary. Routine post pill testing may not be necessary if clinical response is good, and there are no thyrotoxic signs.<br>
			<br>
			Monitor plasma concentration if response is poor after 6-8 weeks of T4 supplementation or if thyrotoxic signs develop - tachycardia, polyuria &plusmn; polydipsia, weight loss, diarrhoea, pyrexia, pruritus, anxiety. Take a  4-8 hour post-pill serum for total T4 measurement - it should be high normal. If the T4 is high, but there are no signs of hyperthyroidism, it is not necessary to lower the dose. T3 concentrations are not helpful in monitoring T4 therapy. If the T4 appears adequate but there has been no clinical improvement consider: wrong diagnosis or antibodies to thyroid hormones.</p>
		<h3>Drug interactions</h3>
		<p>Corticosteroids, phenytoin, salicylates, frusemide and androgens enhance the elimination of T4 by decreasing protein binding. T4 increases the actions of catecholamines, ketamine will cause tachycardia and hypertension when used in patients receiving T4 and the therapeutic effect of digoxin may be reduced by T4. Phenobarbitone increase metabolism of levothyroxine and may require a higher dose to be given. Levothyroxine enhances the effects of warfarin type anticoagulants.<br>
			<br>
			Avoid giving thyroid hormones with other drugs if possible.</p>
		<h2 id="hyperthyr">Hyperthyroidism</h2>
		<p>Is a common problem in middle aged to old cats and is usually a benign tumour of thyroid. It rarely occurs in dogs - associated with thyroid carcinoma</p>
		<h3>Clinical signs</h3>
		<p>	polyuria and polydipsia<br>
				weight loss<br>
				polyphagia<br>
				vomiting<br>
				alopecia/overgrooming<br>
				heart murmur, tachycardia, gallop rhythm</p>
		<h3>Treatment options</h3>
		<p>surgery - thyroidectomy<br>
			radioactive iodine<br>
			antithyroid drugs - carbimazole</p>
		<h3>Radioiodine (radioactive <sup>131</sup>I)</h3>
		<p>A single iv or sc injection (or even an oral dose) is effective in 90-95% of cases - first time failures usually respond to a second dose. No immediate adverse side effects have been reported, although occasionally cats may become hypothyroid. They may show clinical signs of lethargy, bradycardia, thick coat. Supplement T4 for life.<br>
			<br>
			Disadvantages - radiation hazard and need for hospitalisation. A licence is required to posess radioactive materials. Before using, read the Code of safe practice for the treatment of cats for thyroid disorders with iodine-131, issued by: The National Radiation Laboratory, PO Box 25-099, Victoria Street, Christchurch<br>
			<br>
			Recommended reading<br>
			Radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroid cats. BR Jones, J Cayzer, EA Dillon, KP Smidt (1991) NZVJ 99 71-74 .</p>
		<h3>Antithyroid drugs</h3>
		<p>Mechanism of action: block incorporation of iodine into thyroglobulin, prevent coupling of mono- and di-iodotyrosine into T4 and T3 and direct interaction with thyroglobulin molecule. They do not interfere with the ability of the thyroid to trap inorganic iodide and do not block the release of stored thyroid hormone into the circulation.<br>
			<br>
			Methimazole (thiamazole INN) (not available in NZ) and its prodrug carbimazole, which is rapidly converted to methimazole in the body, are most commonly used. Most side effects, vomiting, anorexia and depression, occur in the first two weeks and are mild and transient. Stopping treatment is usually not required. Other uncommon side effects may include hepatopathy, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia: monitor the CBC and platelet count every 2 weeks for 3 months. There is usually an improvement in about two weeks, when the dose is reduced (and ideally titrated against T4 levels).<br>
			<br>
			Propylthiouracil is no longer recommended due to high incidence of anorexia, vomiting, lethargy, immune mediated haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. It has been used (illegally) to promote growth in cattle.</p>
