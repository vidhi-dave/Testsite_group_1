			{
				ques: "Parturition may be induced in dairy cows using",
				ans: "dexamethasone",
				ansSel: ["clenbuterol", "flunixin", "zearalenone", "calcium borogluconate"],
				ansInfo: ["There are species differences, but induction of parturition is only common in cattle. In ruminants, foetal production of corticosteroids causes PGF2&#945; to be released from the placenta which causes parturition to begin. Exogenous corticosteroids mimic this. &#946;2 agonists relax uterine muscle and delay parturition. NSAIDs do not have much effect. Calcium is given to cows where parturition is delayed by uterine inertia caused by hypocalcaemia. It is now considered unethical to induce parturition unless there is a good medical reason."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Prostaglandins in cattle are not involved in",
				ans: "rumination",
				ansSel: ["inflammation", "fever", "parturition","bronchodilatation"],
				ansInfo: ["A variety of PGs are involved in inflammation; PGE2 mediates fever, aspirin blocks cyclo-oxygenase which converts arachidonic acid to PGs. PGF2&#945; causes bronchoconstriction, PGE causes bronchodilatation."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs",
				ans: "inhibit cyclo-oxygenase",
				ansSel: ["block the release of substance P from nociceptors", "prevent vasodilatation caused by CGRP", "block phosphokinase C in dorsal horn neurones"],
				ansInfo: ["All currently used NSAIDs block both COX1 and COX2, although some are reasonably specific. Opioids and capsaicin can affect substance P release, NSAIDs have not been shown to. Although bradykinin can cause pain on its own, its effects are markedly potentiated by PGs. Thus in real life, NSAIDs reduce the pain caused by bradykinin. The vasodilatation produced by calcitonin gene related peptide is thought to be mediated by nitric oxide, NSAIDs have no effect. There is some evidence that prostaglandins block protein kinase C in primary afferent cells."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Paracetamol",
				ans: "can cause liver necrosis in overdose",
				ansSel: ["kills dogs", "causes gastric ulceration", "overdose may be treated with methylene blue", "is safe in cats"],
				ansInfo: ["Paracetamol (acetaminophen) does not usually kill dogs but is very toxic to cats. A toxic intermediate metabolite causes liver damage (Heinz body anaemia can also occur), this is inactivated by glutathione (acetylcysteine is usually given which is converted to glutathione in cells). Paracetamol does not cause gastric ulceration at normal doses."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Hydrocortisone",
				ans: "is effective when swallowed",
				ansSel: ["is synthesised in the adrenal medulla", "has purely mineralocorticoid activity", "can be antagonised by spironalactone", "very rarely causes side effects when used for a long time"],
				ansInfo: ["Hydrocortisone (cortisol), as the name implies, comes from the cortex. It is effective by most routes although it is often given iv. It has equal mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid effects. It will produce the same side effects as any other corticosteroid if given for too long."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Corticosteroids with mainly glucocorticoid activity",
				ans: "have anti-inflammatory actions",
				ansSel: ["include fludrocortisone", "are free of actions in the CNS", "do not suppress hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal function", "include aldosterone"],
				ansInfo: ["All glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory and depress the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis. They all have a wide variety of CNS effects as well. Aldosterone and fludrocortisone are almost purely mineralocorticoid."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Levothyroxine",
				ans: "is converted to the active liothyronine",
				ansSel: ["reduces oxygen consumption in most tissues", "is synthesised in the anterior pituitary", "can act as a growth promoter", "synthesis is reduced by glipizide"],
				ansInfo: ["Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist which reliably causes vomiting in most species. Xylazine causes vomiting in about 30% of dogs. Metaclopramide is a dopamine antagonist whichis usually effective in stopping vomiting. Diazepam has no effect; kaolin and morphine is used to treat diarrhoea."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Prolactin",
				ans: "is secreted from the anterior pituitary",
				ansSel: ["secretion is inhibited by dopamine receptor antagonists", "secretion is increased by bromocriptine", "inhibits the release of growth hormone", "is used to treat infertility"],
				ansInfo: ["Prolactin, like the other anterior pituitary hormones, is under tonic inhibitory dopaminergic control from the hypothalamus. This means that dopamine antagonists increase its secretion and dopamine agonists like bromocriptine reduce its secretion. It is not used clinically."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Insulin",
				ans: "has actions opposite to glucagon",
				ansSel: ["is synthesised in the a cells of the islets of Langerhans", "is effective orally when combined with zinc", "can be antagonised by potassium", "is potentiated by non selective &#946; adrenoceptor blockers"],
				ansInfo: ["The aetiology of COPD is complex, but many cases are improved by bronchodilators. Adrenaline is too short acting to be any use, as well as having major side effects on the heart. Sodium cromoglycate is used for prevention. Acetylcholine and histamine will cause bronchoconstriction. Bacteria are not involved so penicillin does not work."],
			},
			{
				ques: "Hyperthyroidism in the cat",
				ans: "can result in congestive heart failure",
				ansSel: ["causes alopecia", "results in an increase in body weight", "can be treated with tritium", "is characterised by a decrease in thyrotrophin"],
				ansInfo: ["Hypothyroidism causes alopecia and weight gain. Radioactive iodine reduces thyroxin synthesis. Thyrotrophin is usually reduced by negative feedback, but this is not characteristic. CHF is often the presenting sign of hyperthyroidism in cats."],
