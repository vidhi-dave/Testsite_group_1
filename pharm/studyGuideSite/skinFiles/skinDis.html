		<h1>Disinfectants and antiseptics</h1>
		<p><a href="#sumtab">Summary table</a></p>
		<p><b>Disinfectants</b> are chemicals which are lethal to bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, yeast, protozoa or viruses. Just as is the case with antibiotics, some disinfectants are broad in spectrum, whereas others are relatively confined in their spectrum to one or other of these groups of target organisms. Properties of an ideal disinfectant include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>rapidly lethal activity against the broad spectrum of target species
			<li>a low surface tension for ease of spread
			<li>continued activity in the presence of organic matter
			<li>low toxicity
			<li>not corrosive
			<li>low cost.
		</ul>
		<p>An <b>antiseptic</b> is essentially a disinfectant which can be applied to skin or mucus membranes of mammals without causing toxicity. Therefore, the properties of the ideal antiseptic are essentially similar to those of the ideal disinfectant. In addition, an antiseptic ought not be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>irritant to the host&apos;s tissues
			<li>allergenic
			<li>absorbed to any significant extent across the skin
			<li>lacking in pleasant aesthetic properties!
		</ul>
		<p>Frequently the only difference between a disinfectant and an antiseptic is dilution.</p>
		<p>Both disinfectants and antiseptics can be generally classified into broad groupings based on their mechanism of action or chemical structure.</p>
		<h2 id="alc">Alcohols</h2>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Ethanol</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">isopropyl alcohol</span> at dilutions of 70% by weight in water are rapidly bactericidal and virucidal for some virus families. They do not kill spores. Isopropyl alcohol has a more rapid killing action against vegetative bacteria than does ethyl alcohol. Methanol is not a good disinfectant nor antiseptic and is also toxic, therefore is not a good substitute for ethyl or isopropyl alcohols.</p>
		<p>The alcohols act by disrupting cytoplasmic membranes causing disruption of the semi-permeable membrane barrier and resulting in bacterial death through the leakage of cytoplasmic constituents. The genera of large viruses, especially those with lipid membrane coats are also susceptible. The alcohols have no residual effect, being active only whilst in direct contact with the bacteria or virus. A contact time of between 1 and 30 minutes to aqueous dilutions of ethyl alcohol is required for the killing of most organisms. Dilutions of less than 30% of ethanol are not effective.</p>
		<p>Topical application of the alcohols as antiseptics is unlikely to result in a serious toxicity. However, as is well known, oral toxicity of ethyl alcohol involves central nervous system depression which can be life-threatening. Isopropyl alcohol is similar but more potent. It can also cause ketosis. Ethanol and isopropyl alcohol in effective concentrations are inflammable and volatile. They should be used in well ventilated areas and kept in sealed containers somewhere safe. Remember the HSNO Act and OSH.</p>
		<h2 id="ald">Aldehydes</h2>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Glutaraldehyde </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">formaldehyde </span>are both potent and broad spectrum disinfectants and fumigants: they must not be used as antiseptics. They are active against most vegetative bacteria, fungi, yeast, many viruses and some bacterial spores. Glutaraldehyde is usually supplied as a 2% alkaline solution known as activated glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde can also be purchased at higher concentrations or in dry form ready for dilution in water.</p>
		<p>Both formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde react with amide groups of cellular proteins, thereby disrupting cellular protein activity. In addition, glutaraldehyde causes much general coagulation and binds to thiol groups resulting in the production of highly reactive compounds. Some vegetative bacteria are killed within minutes of exposure to glutaraldehyde, but 10-20 minutes of contact with new 2 % glutaraldehyde is necessary for broad spectrum action. As glutaraldehyde ages the contact time required for killing increases. By 28 days in use bactericidal contact times are greater than 1 to 2 hours are often necessary. Because of its pungent odour solutions of formaldehyde are rarely used as disinfectants in veterinary practice.</p>
		<p>It is now well established that glutaraldehyde is dangerous to people inhaling it. In human hospitals exposure of patients to glutaraldehyde has been shown to slow healing. This is a possible concern for veterinary practices. Because of the volatile nature of alkaline activated glutaraldehyde, it must only be used in well ventilated areas. Care must be taken while mixing and while discarding glutaraldehyde preparations to avoid aerosol production. Contact by users to aerosols of glutaraldehyde results in upper respiratory and ocular irritation. Persistent exposure to glutaraldehyde over prolonged periods or single acute large exposures to glutaraldehyde, can cause malaise, anorexia, weakness, rashes or alterations in measurable parameters of the immune system. These parameters include the development of antinuclear antibodies, the development of antibodies to single stranded DNA and disorders of compliment and compliment components.</p>
		<p>Glutaraldehyde should not be used unless there is no alternative. If it is deemed necessary then personal protective equipment and carefully constructed, written guidelines for it use should be available for all workers. The number of people exposed to glutaraldehyde should be minimized.</p>
		<h2 id="hal">Halogens</h2>
		<p>Free <span style="font-weight: bold; ">chlorine </span>in solution is an effective disinfectant, rapidly killing bacteria, many spores, fungi, algae and viruses. Chlorine acts by: direct disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane, reaction with thiol groups on enzymes disrupting their function, reaction with amine groups on cellular proteins and production of highly reactive compounds.</p>
		<p>Chlorine is normally made available in solution by the addition to water of salts of hypochlorites. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sodium hypochlorite</span> is the most commonly used salt, which is stable at an alkaline pH, but which at an acid pH releases chlorine. The concentration of chlorine resulting in solution is a function of the concentration of sodium hypochlorite and the pH. Label recommendations should be followed closely to produce a final solution which is an effective disinfectant.</p>
		<p>Chlorine disinfectants are irritant to tissues and should not be used as antiseptics. Care should be taken in their preparation, use and disposal to avoid endangering the health of the people handling the disinfectant. Sodium hypochlorite loses activity on exposure to air and light. New solutions should be prepared frequently. Chlorine adheres to organic matter and becomes unavailable. Chlorine is also corrosive and bleaches textiles.</p>
		<p>If hypochlorite solutions are mixed with acids or ammonia solutions, free chlorine or chloramine gas is produced, which is very irritant.</p>
		<p>Municipal water supplies sometimes have chlorine added in the form of <span style="font-weight: bold; ">chloramine</span>, but this seldom causes problems.</p>
		<p>Free <span style="font-weight: bold; ">iodine </span>in aqueous solution (Lugol&apos;s solution) is effective against bacteria, bacterial spores, yeast, fungi and most viruses. Iodine is also active in alcoholic solution (known as tincture of iodine). Iodine has a bactericidal action through interference with the electron transport chain and with the function of thiol groups on bacterial enzymes.</p>
		<p>Alcoholic solutions of iodine lose their potency rapidly on exposure to air, both through evaporation of the solvent and through loss of the iodine (which is a volatile molecule). Alcoholic preparations of iodine are also drying to skin and irritant. Exposure of animals to Lugol&apos;s solution or tincture of iodine has resulted in central nervous system depression and in suppression of thyroid hormone production.</p>
		<p>These disadvantages of iodine have been largely overcome by formulation with active carrier agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidine (povidone). Formulations of iodine with povidone and other similar polymers are collectively known as the <span style="font-weight: bold; ">iodophors</span>. Povidone in aqueous solution above a critical concentration forms aggregations known as micelles. Iodine dissolves into the micelles from which it is slowly released as free iodine into the aqueous solution for activity against bacteria etc. Therefore, if povidone iodine preparations are diluted below the critical micellar concentration, the reservoir for iodine is lost and the volatile free iodine is therefore depleted. This results in rapid loss of activity.</p>
		<p>Iodophors are popular as surgical scrub solutions and as antiseptics. They have an extremely broad spectrum of activity, low toxicity, low propensities for sensitization, stability and low likelihood of bacteria developing resistance. However, they can be absorbed in some situations, such as burn treatment. They are corrosive to metal instruments.</p>
		<p>In comparison to chlorhexidine the iodophors have a slower bactericidal action. Therefore, the use of iodophors as surgical scrub solutions requires more care. Strict adherence to recommended duration of pre-surgical scrub procedure is necessary. An inadequate period of contact between the iodophor and the skin will result in fewer bacteria being killed. Nevertheless, the iodophors are very useful in surgical scrub solutions.</p>
		<h2 id="phenol">Phenols and Cresols</h2>
		<p>Phenols are rapidly bactericidal and virucidal for some germs. Their activity depends upon:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>direct action on the cell wall
			<li>interference with action potential on cell membranes
			<li>alterations to cell membrane permeability
			<li>general coagulation of cell constituents.
		</ul>
		<p>Phenols are all irritant, unless very dilute. They can also cause allergic dermatitis in people.</p>
		<p>These disinfectants have fallen into disuse since the development of more effective and safer agents. Nevertheless many phenol-containing disinfectants are still used principally as toilet cleaners and as floor detergents. These products often have a pleasant smell and lack of contact irritation.</p>
		<p>For most species, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">diluted </span>phenols are minimally toxic. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Cats are an exception</span>. Cats are extremely sensitive to phenol induced toxicity, showing CNS signs of seizure and coma. Phenols should be used with care in areas to which cats have access - remember that cats lick their feet.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Hexachlorophene </span>is a chlorinated phenol which is distinguished from most disinfectants by its ability to work in the presence of anionic soaps. Therefore hexachlorophene is formulated as both hard and liquid soaps. When used repeatedly over prolonged periods, hexachlorophene results in a decrease in the density of skin commensals and is sometimes used as a routine soap by surgeons. However, hexachlorophene is not recommended as a pre-surgical scrub solution. Triclosan is similar.</p>
		<p>Pine oil is similar to the phenols in smell, uses and toxicology. It is fine for cleaning toilets, but keep it away from animals.</p>
		<h2 id="qta">Quaternary Ammonium Compounds</h2>
		<p>The quaternary ammonium compounds are highly surface active agents. Their activity depends upon general coagulation of cell components. The commonly known quaternary ammonium compounds include <span style="font-weight: bold; ">benzalkonium </span>chloride, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">cetrimide </span>(cetavlon) and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">cetyl pyridium</span> chloride.</p>
		<p>The quaternary ammonium compounds are rapidly bactericidal against Gram positive bacteria and have some Gram negative activity. Their major drawback is that some Gram negative organisms including <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>spp., may thrive in these solutions. Quaternary ammoniums possess some fungicidal activity, but are not active against bacterial spores or viruses. The activity of this group of disinfectants is markedly inhibited by the presence of organic matter. Therefore thorough cleaning is required before their use.</p>
		<p>These compounds have little place in modern disinfection despite their continued wide availability.</p>
		<p>Cetrimide is frequently included at approximately 3% in formulations intended for use as antiseptics. Cetrimide in these products is included primarily for its detergent properties rather than its properties as a disinfectant. Cetrimide improves the general cleansing action. Unfortunately, cetrimide frequently causes contact sensitivities. Veterinarians with contact sensitivity to antiseptics in use in their practice should check if cetrimide and other quaternary ammoniums are part of the formulation.</p>
		<p>High concentrations are very caustic.</p>
		<h2 id="bigu">Biguanides</h2>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Chlorhexidine </span>is a biguanide antiseptic with a wide spectrum of activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative vegetative bacteria. Chlorhexidine is not sporicidal, fungicidal or virucidal. The mechanisms of action of chlorhexidine are general coagulation of cell components, alteration of cell membrane permeability and inhibition of the enzyme adenosine triphosphatase.</p>
		<p>Chlorhexidine has a rapid action. It use during surgical site preparation and hand scrubbing results in significant decrease in bacterial numbers within one or two minutes of contact time. Chlorhexidine also has residual action which results in a decreased rate of recontamination of surgical sights or hands when compared to other surgical scrub solutions.</p>
		<p>Chlorhexidine is rarely toxic to mammals unless it gets into eyes or ears. It has been used to promote scar formation in people. Chronic or repeated exposures to chlorhexidine containing surgical scrub solutions can cause skin sensitization in people. It is probable that this is usually caused by surface active agents such as cetrimide in the scrub.</p>
		<h2 id="ox">Oxidising agents</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold; ">Virkon</span>&rdquo; is a mixture of oxidising agents (notably potassium monopersulphate), a surfactant (a rapidly-degraded alkyl benzene sulphonate), organic acids and an inorganic buffer system. It is effective against most species of bacteria, fungi, yeast, bacterial spores and viruses including <span style="font-style: italic; ">Parvovirus</span>. It also has some effect against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Cryptosporidium </span>cysts. It is available as a powder which when mixed according to label directions provides a strong oxidising solution. Virkon has little, if any, oral or contact toxicity. It is as yet unknown whether infectious organisms are able to develop resistance to this disinfectant.</p>
		
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Hydrogen peroxide</span> is occasionally used as an antiseptic. It releases oxygen on contact with tissue which kills many bacteria; the frothing action also removes muck.</p>		
		<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous Disinfectants</h2>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Thiram</span> is a powder which has action as a disinfectant when in suspension in water (it is virtually insoluble). It is fungicidal and bacteriostatic and is included in some bacteriostatic soaps. Thiram has little application in companion animal or equine practice.</p>
		
		<p><b>Steam</b> (usually produced by a hot water blaster) kills most things and is a good way of disinfecting premises. It must be kept well away from animals and people.</p>
		<p>Ultraviolet and &#947; radiation kill many bacteria. &#947; rays penetrate packing and are used for some surgical instruments and consumables.</p>
