  <QUESTION TEXT="1. Most drugs produce their effects by binding to"
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Most drugs produce their effects by binding to receptors. Many drugs interact with the other choices, but with the exception of osmotic diuretics interacting with water, interactions with the others are usually incidental to the drugs' action.">

    <CHOICE>lipids</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>water</CHOICE>

  <QUESTION TEXT="2. An ED50 is a measure of"
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="An ED50 is the dose which is effective in producing a specified response in 50% of animals, eg the minimal alveolar concentration of an anaesthetic.">

    <CHOICE>potency</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>affinity</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="3. Cyclic AMP is" 
  	ANSWER="3" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Cyclic AMP is a second messenger inside cells. &#946; adrenoceptor agonists activate adenylyl cyclase via a G protein; adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterase. Many phosphodiesterase inhibitors are also CNS stimulants by other mechanisms.">
    <CHOICE>a neurotransmitter</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>inactivated by uptake</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>released by beta agonists</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>an essential fatty acid</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>a CNS stimulant</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="4. Phospholipase C is an enzyme which" 
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="PLC is a G protein regulated enzyme which liberates the second messenger inositol triphosphate (IP3)from membrane triglycerides; PLA2 produces arachidonic acid. IP3 causes the mobilisation of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. Lipocortin (increased by steroids) inhibits PLA2 but not PLC. G proteins bind GTP and hydrolyse it.">
    <CHOICE>is regulated by G proteins</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>converts arachidonic acid to PGG</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>phosphorylates G proteins</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is a 2nd messenger</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is a target for steroids</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>  
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="5. Antagonists" 
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="An antagonist may be completely different size and shape from an agonist at the same receptor. The antagonist's job is to bind to the receptor and stop anything else getting access, so the binding site may (or may not) be similar. Irreversible antagonists change conformation after binding and stay there, reversible antagonists usually compete with the agonist for space at the receptor. Antagonists are often more specific for one class of receptor than agonists. An antagonist by definition has zero efficacy, most must have high affinity to work.">
    <CHOICE>can be reversible or irreversible</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>have a low affinity and a high efficacy</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>produce opposite effects to agonists</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>are larger molecules than agonists</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>are usually non-specific</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="6. Competitive antagonism exists when" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="The agonist and antagonist must both have affinity for the same receptor but this does not mean that they compete for it. If competitive antagonism exists, increasing the dose of agonist will overcome the antagonism. Antagonists always have zero efficacy. If the antagonist binds to a different receptor, it cannot compete with the agonist. Potency is irrelevant.">
    <CHOICE>the agonist and antagonist bind to the same receptor</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>the antagonism can be overcome by increasing the dose of agonist</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>only the antagonist has appreciable efficacy</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>the antagonist acts through different receptors</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>the antagonist is more potent than the agonist</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="7. If the EC50 of a drug is 10e-7 then" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="The EC50 is the concentration of agonist which produces a response which is 50% of maximum. The Kd is the concentration of drug which occupies 50% of receptors. It is possible, but unlikely, that these two will be the same. Doubling the concentration does not necessarily double the effect since the relationship is not a straight line. Antagonists do not produce a response so they cannot have an EC50. The therapeutic index is calculated from the ED50 and the LD50, not the EC50.">
    <CHOICE>the Kd must be the same</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>maximal response will be at 2 x 10e-7</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>it is a competitive antagonist</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>half maximal response will be at 10e-7</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>it has a lower therapeutic index than a drug with an EC50 of 10e-8</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="8. Ionotropic receptors are" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Ionotropic receptors are ligand gated ion channels. They are not coupled to G proteins and do not require second messengers to produce their effects. They do not catalyse reactions, they merely open to let sodium and sometimes calcium ions through.">
    <CHOICE>activated by G proteins</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>ion channels</CHOICE>
	<CHOICE>able to use IP3 as a 2nd messenger</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>enzymes</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>usually permeable to Mg ions</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="9. Partial agonists usually have" 
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Partial agonists have a lower efficacy than full agonists; they still occupy the receptors and prevent any full agonist present from binding, ie, they can act as antagonists, but not inverse agonists. If there is a large receptor reserve, partial agonists can produce a maximal effect in some tissues, but this is not generally the case. Desensitisation is irrelevant.">
    <CHOICE>a low efficacy</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>the same effect as full agonists but at higher doses</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>a maximal effect if there is a small receptor reserve</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>an ability to act as  inverse agonists</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>reduced effects because they desensitise receptors</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="10. A dog is given an anaesthetic premed containing buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist, to prevent pain during the operation. It receives fentanyl, a full opioid agonist druing the op, followed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist (to counteract the respiratory depressant side effects of the opioids). How would you control the dogâ€™s pain with opioids post op?" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Buprenorphine is a partially irreversible partial agonist: it takes about 45 minutes to bind to the receptors and the same to dissociate. Its peak effect is less than a full agonist. Fentanyl is a full agonist, but is too short acting to be much use for post op pain. Any other full agonist still has the problem of the receptors being occupied by some of the other drugs given. Placing a local block is a sensible choice and should be done anyway. The object of the exercise is to relive the dog's pain, not prevent it showing the signs of pain, so a sedative is contra-indicated (and would probably not work anyway).">
    <CHOICE>give more buprenorphine iv</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>give a bolus of fentanyl iv</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>use a different agonist such as morphine</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>give a high dose fentanyl infusion iv</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>sedate the dog</CHOICE>
