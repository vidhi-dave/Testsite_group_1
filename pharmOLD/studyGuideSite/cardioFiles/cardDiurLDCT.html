<p>Aldosterone is a steroid hormone which binds to a nuclear receptor which stimulates 
  transcription mRNA which codes for the basolateral Na/K-ATPase pump and the 
  luminal Na+ channels. This leads to an increase in Na/K-ATPase pump activity 
  and therefore an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> resorption. K<sup>+</sup> is lost in exchange for resorbed 
  Na<sup>+</sup> to maintain electronutrality.<br>
  <strong>Spironolactone</strong> is structuraly similar to aldosterone and acts 
  as a competitive antagonist of aldosterone. Therefore spironolactone inhibits 
  aldosterone's action on the cells located between the distal renal tubules and 
  the collecting ducts called the &quot;principal cells of cortical collecting 
  ducts&quot; and causes an increased excretion of Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and water and a decreased 
  excretion of K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub>, P0<sub>4</sub> It has no effect on carbonic anhydrase or renal transport 
  mechanisms. It has its greatest effect in patients with hyperaldosteronism. 
  It usually elicits only mild diuresis. It is useful in congestive heart failure 
  because of its interactions with the RAAS, but also interacts with oestrogen 
  and testosterone receptors and is going out of fashion in people because of 
  this.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Indications</p>
<p>limited degree of diuresis when used on its own<br>
  -used in combination with other classes, especially loop diuretics, in patients 
  where hypokalaemia due to other diuretics is likely to cause serious problems 
  especially if on digitalis or if unable to supplement with dietary potassium<br>
  - used in combination with other classes in cases of severe fluid retention 
  eg. refractory ascites, pulmonary oedema secondary to heart failure which is 
  non-responsive<br>
  Used for heart failure in people &plusmn; <a href="cardACEin.html">ACE inhibitors</a> 
  - too expensive in animals.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Pharmacokinetics</p>
<p><em>Absorption</em> - gradual onset of action, peak at 48-72 hours, duration 
  for 2-3 days after therapy has stopped<br>
  <em>Distribution</em> - 98% bound to plasma protein - CBG - corticosteroid binding 
  globulin and albumin<br>
  <em>Metabolism</em> - rapidly metabolised to a number of metabolites one of 
  which (canrenone) is thought to also have diuretic activity<br>
  - spironolactone has a short tl/2 of 1-2 hours in humans where as canrenone 
  has a tl/2 of about 20 hours</p>
<p><strong>Triamterene</strong> and <strong>amiloride</strong> directly block 
  sodium channels on apical (luminal) membrane and therefore decrease Na+ flux 
  which in turn causes a decrease in K+ transport. This only occurs if Na/K transport 
  is increased ie. using other diuretics or there is a physiological defect. They 
  have no effect on normal animals. They act within 2 hours, peak 6-8 hours, duration 
  12-16 hours<br>
  These drugs can produce hyperkalaemia if they are combined with potassium supplementation 
  or <a href="cardACEin.html">ACE inhibitors</a>.</p>
