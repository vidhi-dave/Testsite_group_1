<p class="titleSG">Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</p>

<input type="Button" value="Previous Page" onClick="history.go(-1)">


<p>Some of the few drugs proven to prolong life in dogs. Many ACE inhibitors are available, there is no obvious difference between them apart from duration of action. Most of the modern ones are prodrugs.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Physiology</p>
<p>The renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system (<a href="cardACEiDia.html">diagram</a>) 
  is an important mechanism for maintaining blood pressure in the face of various 
  challenges. Renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus is stimulated by 
  a fall in blood pressure, reduced renal blood flow, reduced sodium concentration 
  in the distal tubule, increased renal sympathetic activity and a host of other 
  factors poorly understood. b agonists and PGI2 also stimulate renin production. 
  Atrial natriuretic peptide reduces renin production: angiotensin II does the 
  same, possibly by the same mechanism. Renin then converts angiotensinogen to 
  angiotensin I.<br>
  ACE inhibitors block the enzyme which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 
  II. Most of their effects can be attributed to a reduction in ATII levels. ATII 
  produces most of its effects at the confusingly named AT1 receptors (see <a href="cardACEiDia.html">diagram</a>).<br>
  ACE is also responsible for breaking down bradykinin which can act as a vasodilator 
  by stimulating PLA2 which results in the production of prostacyclin, and by 
  causing the release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells.<br>
  Most ACE is bound to the surface of endothelial cells, but it can occur in other 
  tissues such as cardiac muscle. ACE inhibitors tend to reverse the cardiac hypertrophy 
  seen in heart failure. </p>
<p class="footerSG">Effects</p>
<p>In normal healthy animals and people, ACE inhibitors have no effect after a 
  single dose and cause only a small drop in blood pressure after several days&#8217; 
  treatment. It seems likely that there has to be increased renin release (and 
  thus more ATI available for conversion to ATII) before ACE inhibitors have much 
  effect. Most dogs with congestive heart failure will have increased sympathetic 
  tone, and may also have reduced arterial blood pressure leading to increased 
  renin release. Some dogs may be on low salt diets in an attempt to cause sodium 
  depletion.<br>
  The end result in dogs with CHF is that there is a decrease in venous and diastolic 
  intra-cardiac pressure with a concurrent decrease in afterload and so a resultant 
  increase in cardiac output. They relax both capacitance and resistance vessels, 
  but preferentially affect the kidney heart and brain. They are often used with 
  diuretics such as frusemide (although frusemide probably has some vasodilator 
  action of its own), but the interactions can cause kidney failure (see below). 
  ACE inhibitors have their own mild diuretic and natriuretic effect.<br>
  The vasodilatation produced by increased bradykinin may also be important in 
  heart failure.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Indications</p>
<p>vasodilator in the treatment of <a href="cardCHF.html">congestive heart failure</a>, especially valvular disease</p>
<p class="footerSG">Side effects</p>
<p>hypotension in overdose<br>
  anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea<br>
  at high doses glomerular lesions and renal failure (monitor BUN and serum creatinine) 
  may be induced<br>
  since they also inhibit aldosterone they may cause a hyperkalaemia therefore 
  monitor electrolytes especially if using potassium sparing diuretics as well<br>
  In people, ACE inhibitors often cause coughing - thought to be caused by increased 
  bradykinin in the airways.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Precautions</p>
<p>care in renal insufficiency patients (<a href="cardACEinKid.html">more</a>)<br>
  caution in hyponatraemia, pre-existing haematological abnormalities or a collagen 
  vascular disease ie. systemic lupus erythematosus<br>
  breeding / pregnant dogs (uterine relaxation)</p>
<p class="footerSG">Drugs</p>
<p><strong>Captopril</strong> has a short half life in the dog (3 hours), so must 
  be given two or three times daily. <strong>Enalapril</strong> is basically the 
  same as captopril except that it is a prodrug, which is metabolised by plasma 
  esterases to the active metabolite enalaprilat. This active drug has a longer 
  therapeutic duration than captopril, enabling once daily dosing in dogs. It 
  has been proven in clinical trials to increase the life span of dogs with congestive 
  heart failure (in combination with the diuretic frusemide). <strong>Benazepril</strong> 
  is similar to the other ACE inhibitors, suitable for once daily dosing. The 
  human drug <strong>quinapril</strong> is sometimes used in dogs because it is 
  cheap.<br>
  There are dozens of other ACE inhibitors in human use, which probably also work 
  in animals.</p>
<p>AT1 receptor antagonists such as <strong>losartan</strong> and <strong>candesartan</strong> 
  are starting to be used in people. They may be slightly more effective (ATII 
  can be formed by other routes than ACE) and have fewer side effects. They are 
  used mainly in patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors, and there is no 
  experience in domestic animals.</p>
