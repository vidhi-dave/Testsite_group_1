  <QUESTION TEXT="1. Congestive heart failure in the dog may be treated with"
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Atropine causes tachycardia which increases oxygen consumption and makes the myocardium work less efficiently. Frusemide is a diuretic which reduces preload and possibly afterload, reducing the work the heart has to do. Nitroprusside is a vasodilator which is sometimes used in acute heart failure. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic which increases preload and is likely to kill a dog in heart failure, bradykinin concentrations increase as a side effect of ACE inhibition.">

  <QUESTION TEXT="2. Ventricular ectopic beats may be usefully treated with"
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Ventricular ectopic beats usually arise from hypoxia in dogs; the failing myocardial cells are unable to maintain the membrane potential and some cells fire spontaneously. Drugs which speed the heart up such as atropine and isoprenaline, will make the hypoxia worse, lignocaine raises the firing threshold of the myocardial cells. Nicardipine mainly causes vasodilatation, although it may have some effect on teh heart. Digoxin may have a long term beneficial effect by improving cardiac function - if the animal survives the arrhythmia!">

  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="3. Useful effects of digoxin include" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Digoxin has a direct positive inotropic effect and a indirect AV blocking effect. The latter can be useful in atrial fibrillation. It is often given with diuretics, most of which cause potassium loss as a side effect. It has no effect on bronchodilatation or euphoria (at least in people).">

    <CHOICE>atrio-ventricular node blockade</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>bronchodilatation</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>euphoria</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>increased potassium secretion</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="4. Side-effects of dopamine infusion can include" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Dopamine can cause splanchnic vasodilatation (by an action at dopamine receptors) and venentricular ectopic beats and increased oxygen consumption by an action at b1 receptors. It does not cross the blood brain barrier (except at the chemoreceptor trigger zone) so it will not cause convulsions or Parkinson's.">

    <CHOICE>ventricular ectopic beats</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>heart block</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>convulsions</CHOICE>

  <QUESTION TEXT="5. Quinidine" 
  	ANSWER="5" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Quinidine is usually used for atrial tachyarrhythmias. b blockers (class 2) prolong phase 4. Quinidine is chemically the same as quinine (both are complex molecules from cinchona bark)but not chloroquin and completely different from lignocaine.">
  	<CHOICE>is an isomer of chloroquine</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is useful in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>prolongs phase 4 of the cardiac action potential</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is rapidly metabolised to lignocaine in the plasma</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is a Vaughan Williams class 1 drug</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="6. Diuretics which are clinically useful in the dog include" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic which is occasionally useful. Glycerol also has an osmotic effect, but makes dogs vomit and is rarely used except in emergency treatment of glaucoma. Bethanecol and propantheline are not diuretics. Mersalyl is an organic mercury compound which used to be used for diuresis but is too toxic.">

  <QUESTION TEXT="7. Hydrochlorothiazide may" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Hydrochlorothiazide is a typical thiazide diuretic - it has no effect on carbonic anhydrase. Thiazides are used to treat diabetes insipidus and cause major potassium loss. Less tolerance develops than with other diuretics.">
  	<CHOICE>inhibit carbonic anhydrase at clinical dose rates</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>cause diabetes mellitus</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>produce sedation</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>cause potassium loss</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>quickly give rise to tolerance</CHOICE>

  <QUESTION TEXT="8. Piglet anaemia may be prevented using" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Piglets require a constant intake of ferrous (not ferric) iron. This could be supplied by oral dosing, but a slow release im injection is much less work! Desferrioxamine is given in iron overdose.">
  	<CHOICE>oral vitamin B 12</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>oral ferrous sulphate</CHOICE>

  <QUESTION TEXT="9. 7.5% saline solution" 
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Hypertonic (usually 7%) saline is used in small quantities to draw water into the circulation from interstitial fluid. It can be used in shock as a first aid measure - more water must be supplied later either orally or iv - but it is contra-indicated in cardiogenic shock. Its positive inotropic action is not always obvious as it can cause vasodilatation as well.">

    <CHOICE>is a good treatment for dehydration</CHOICE>

  ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Any fluid which supplies volume can be used in acute haemorrhage, but if the bleeding is severe, red cells, platelets and clotting factors are needed. Colloids are better than crystalloids, since they stay in the circulation longer. Heparin is an anticoagulant and is likely to make the bleeding worse.">
