		<p class="footerSG">Parenteral vs oral fluids</p>
		<p>Regulation of water and electrolytes (and thus blood volume) is a function of the kidney. If there is not enough blood flow to the kidney, this regulation breaks down. However, if the kidneys are working and the animal is not vomiting, <b>oral administration</b> is best - the kidneys are better at working out the animal's requirements than most veterinary surgeons. The commonest situation where oral fluids are used is diarrhoea, particularly in large animals.</p>
		<p>In most other circumstances, <b>intravenous administration</b> (via a large bore indwelling catheter) is best. If the animal's blood volume is low, a vein may be hard to find. The answer is to do a sterile cut down onto the vein; this is quicker and better for the animal than prolonged poking about in the region of the vein followed by administration of fluids by an inappropriate route.</p>
		<p class="body"><a href="images/cutDown3.mov" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'name','400','320','yes');return false">cutdown on lateral saphenous vein</a>, movie (6.7MB)</p>
		<p>If all else fails, fluids can be given <b>intraperitoneally</b>. Since the peritoneal cavity is only a potential space under normal circumstances, the chances of hitting an organ with the needle are high.</p>
		<p><b>Subcutaneous administration</b> is not a good way to give fluids because if the animal has a low blood volume / acidosis the blood vessels supplying the skin will be constricted. This is done to divert blood to vital organs but also means that the fluid will not be absorbed. Some fluids (dextrose 5%) will cause vasoconstriction directly and actually draw fluid out of the circulation into the subcutaneous depot.</p>
		<p><b>Intraosseous administration</b> has been advocated in puppies and kittens. Injections by this route are extremely painful in man, when a neonatal animal is so sick as to be unable to fight back it is hardly sporting to subject it to excruciating pain as well. Infection is another problem when using this route - the consequences are likely to be disastrous.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">General indications for fluids</p>
		<p><i>for oxygen carriage</i></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>whole blood<br>
				packed cells</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>for volume expansion</i></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>colloids<br>
				plasma<br>
				gelatins<br>
				starches<br>
				hypertonic saline<br>
				(dextrans) (but almost any fluid will do in an emergency)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>for water and electrolyte replacement</i></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>crystalloids<br>
				NaCl 0.9%<br>
				NaCl 0.18% &amp; dextrose 4%<br>
				dextrose 5%<br>
				(Ringer's solution)<br>
				Hartmann's solution<br>
				concentrated electrolyte solutions</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>KCl (<span class="titleLec">must be diluted</span>)<br>
					NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 8.4% (<span class="titleLec">must be diluted</span>)<br>
					Ca (boro)gluconate<br>
					Mg hypophosphite (often combined with Ca)<br>
					MgSO<sub>4 </sub>(<span class="titleLec">must be diluted</span> if given iv)</p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>for parenteral nutrition</i></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>lipid emulsions<br>
				amino acid solutions<br>
				propylene glycol (ruminants only)<br>
				Na propionate (ruminants only)<br>
				glycerol (ruminants only)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="footerSG">Dose calculations</p>
		<p>Start by assessing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>existing deficit - careful history, clinical examination, laboratory tests
			<li>continuing losses - measured directly
			<li>maintenance requirements - 40ml/kg/day
		</ul>
		<p>After fluid replacement starts the <span class="titleLec">animals should be assessed regularly</span> and the dose adjusted according to clinical progress. Remember that not all animals have read the book - some will need more than others!</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Rate of administration</p>
		<p>This depends entirely on the seriousness of the condition. A maxiumum rate of 90ml/kg/h iv is sometimes quoted but the limiting factor is usually the resistance (ie, size) of the intravenous catheter / needle. If you want the fluid to go in quickly use a big, short catheter, or better still, lots of them! This can be a problem in horses, as iv catheters only come in human sizes. Some specialized large cathers are available but are expensive.</p>
		<p>If the volume of oral fluid administered is greater than the volume of the animal's stomach then the fluid will rapidly come back up and you will find yourself treating inhalation pneumonia.</p>
