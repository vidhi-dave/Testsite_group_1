		<p class="footerSG">Principles of Topical Therapy</p>
		<p>The skin is the easiest organ to examine. It is also easy to sample to aid diagnosis. Treatment is most likely to succeed if targeted at a specific aetiological diagnosis. As a less satisfactory alternative, a morphological diagnosis may often suffice.</p>
		<p>When treating skin disease first consider whether systemic treatment is more appropriate than topical then select and implement any necessary ancillary therapy. Consider the actions of both the active ingredients and the vehicles of chosen topical formulations; then apply chosen topical drug formulations. Consider ramifications of systemic absorption of either the active drug or vehicle.</p>
		<p>A rule of thumb for topical therapy is</p>
		<ul>
			<li>if it is wet, dry it
			<li>if it is dry, wet it
		</ul>
		<p class="footerSG">Pharmacokinetics</p>
		<p>Drug Penetration depends on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>state of hydration of stratum corneum
			<li>body condition
			<li>surface area
			<li>hair follicles
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>number
					<li>density
					<li>type
				</ul>
			<li>blood flow rate
				<ul>
					<li>exercise
					<li>inflammation
				</ul>
			
			<li>skin thickness
			<li>ambient temperature
			<li>rainfall
			<li>concentration of active drug molecule in the applied formulation
			<li>solvent / carrier (vehicle)
			<li>solubility (lipid/water partition coefficient)
			<li>alteration to hydration state of keratinized layers
		</ul>
		<p class="footerSG">Topical formulations</p>
		<p>A number of substances are used in topical preparations, both for their non-specific effects and as vehicles for active ingredients.</p>
		<p><span class="footerSG">demulcents</span></p>
		<p>These are water soluble ointments or creams which coat the surface, reduce dehydration, partially rehydrate and relieve irritation. They include gums, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, etc.,glycerol (glycerin), propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol. These last two substances are very different, despite their similar names. Propylene glycol is similar to other alcohols, and can be irritant to exposed sensitive tissues, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is inert. PEG comes as a variety of different molecular weights, which range from an oily liquid (PEG200) to a waxy solid (PEG35k).</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">emollients</span></p>
		<p>Inert oils which occlude the stratum corneum and reduce dehydration. They may be either oil in water suspensions or water in oil suspensions. They include: vegetable oils e.g. castor, animal fats e.g. lanolin, other oils e.g. liquid paraffin</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">protectives and adsorbents</span></p>
		<p>These reduce contact exposure to irritants and allergens although they may have some direct actions to increase evaporation, block pruritus, adsorb toxins and reduce inflammation. They include: starch, especially oatmeal, talc (quite irritant to exposed tissue), zinc oxide, boric acid, gelatin, lanolin, olive and mineral oils, kaolin</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">astringents</span></p>
		<p>Dry the skin or precipitate proteins if applied to wounds. They include: salts of Al, K, Zn, Ag, Fe, tannic acid, vegetable acids. Copper and zinc salts are sometimes used in this way for foot rot.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">counterirritants</span></p>
		<p>(= rubefacients, vessicants, blistering agents) These irritate the skin to induce hyperaemia and inflammation and &ldquo;promote healing&rdquo;. They may cause blisters. They may produce a placebo effect in people (&ldquo;I can feel it burning so it must be doing some good!&rdquo;) but their use in animals is obselete and unethical.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">caustics</span></p>
		<p>Historically used to &quot;treat&quot; lameness in horses and to seal open wounds (as was actual cautery, ie firing). They are likely to cause pain and suffering and should not be used. The more caustic astringents are sometimes used to stop bleeding after over enthusiastic nail clipping and to remove warts. Active ingredients silver nitrate, ferric chloride or salicylate.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">keratolytics</span></p>
		<p>Dissolve the intercellular cement and allow increased desquamation of keratocytes. They are used to treat hyperkeratosis. Active ingredients: benzoyl peroxide (also acts as antiseborrheic by opening the sebaceous gland pores), coal tar, zinc pyridinethione, salicylate, selenium sulphide, urea</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">antiseborrhoeics</span></p>
		<p>Reduce excessive sebaceous gland secretions primarily by reducing inflammation. Active ingredients: selenium sulphide, coal tars (do not use on cats - they have problems metabolising phenolic compounds).</p>
		<p class="footerSG">topical anti-inflammatories</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">topical steroids</span></p>
		<p>fluocinolone, beclomethasone, hydrocortisone, triamcinolone, betamethasone. In people, these can sometimes cause an allergic reaction (to the vehicle?) so systemic steroids are usually used.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)</span></p>
		<p>DMSO is widely used in veterinary medicine. It is a solvent which rapidly penetrates the skin itself and is rapidly distributed throughout the body by the blood. It enhances penetration of solutes, drugs, toxins etc. Therefore, care must be exercised in its use, including wearing butyl rubber gloves during application. It also acts as a rubefacient (increasing blood flow) and stimulates mast cell degranulation at high doses.</p>
		<p>It has potent anti-inflammatory activity, it is a free radical scavenger, it interferes with fibroblasts and collagen production, it may be antimicrobial, it may have some muscle relaxant properties and is analgesic, probably by direct interference with C fibre afferent neurones.</p>
		<p>It is used clinically as a gel or solution applied topically to reduce acute swelling due to trauma, and as a vehicle for other drugs. It is used iv for treating acute cranial trauma in horses - great care in dilution and dose rate is necessary.</p>
		<p>DMSO&rsquo;s side effects include local burning, itching, diuresis, blockade of collagen production, teratogenicity, lenticular cataracts, haemolysis (if too rapid or too concentrated iv), convulsions and pulmonary oedema. It may also be carcinogenic - it is rapidly going out of use from fears about clients absorbing it.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">&ldquo;inert&rdquo; vehicles</p>
		<p>These are important since they are responsible for the absorption and many of the side effects of the active drugs. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">These can cause enormous variations in clinical effect between different formulations containing the same active ingredient</span>. Commonly used vehicles include: aqueous creams, emulsifying ointments, hydrous ointments, white soft paraffin, starch powders, various lotions, gels and aqueous sprays. Nasty chemicals such as dimethyl formamide are sometimes used to get drugs across the skin in animals, safer products such as pluronic lecithin organogels are starting to be used in people, and to a lesser extent, in animals.</p>
		<p>Since you are unlikely to be making up your own topical formulations, these will not be covered further.</p>
