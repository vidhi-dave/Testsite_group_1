<p class="titleSG">Urinary incontinence</p>
<p>For the bladder to fill normally, the muscle of the bladder wall must be relaxed and the sphincter contracted; this is reversed for micturition. Incontinence can arise from excessive tone in the bladder wall during filling (<a href="autonBladCyst.html">cystitis</a>, nerve deficits from spinal injury, idiopathic detrusor instability) or from lack of tone in the bladder wall (nerve deficits from spinal injury) or sphincter (usually bitches spayed before their first oestrus).</p>
<p><a href="autonBladDia.html">diagram</a></p>
<p>Otherwise obscure drugs are often chosen for use in the bladder in the hope 
  that they will not cross the blood brain barrier and thus give rise to central 
  effects. They are not always sucessful at this and will usually give rise to 
  the full range of peripheral side effects as well.</p>

<p class="footerSG"><a name="antich"></a>Anticholinergics</p>
<p>Propantheline is used in detrusor instability (increased contraction of the 
  body of the bladder - rare in animals but common in women) to relax bladder 
  and allow filling. More specific drugs such as tolterodine are used in people. 
  Anticholinergics are contra - indicated in urinary obstruction and glaucoma.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="alph"></a>Alpha adrenergic agonists and sex hormones</p>
<p>Urinary incontinence in spayed bitches is a common problem. Oestrogens upregulate ?1 adrenergic receptors in the internal sphincter, a lack of oestrogen reduces the number of ?1 receptors and thus the ability to contract the sphincter. Therefore oestrogens given with ?1 agonists produce the greatest effect. Since oestrogens cause a wide range of side effects in dogs and ?1 agonists cause vasoconstriction, low doses of both drugs will reduce the side effects. Oestrogen treatments take several weeks to work but ?1 agonists can work almost immediately. Probably the best treatment strategy is to try ?1 agonists first, increase the dose if there is no response and then add in low dose oestrogens if there is still no response or side effects are seen.</p>
<p><strong>Phenylpropanolamine</strong> is the most widely used &#945;1 agonist. 
  It is considered safe in dogs but increases the risk of stroke in women (it 
  causes vasocontriction and increased blood pressure). <strong>Ephedrine</strong> 
  should not be used as it crosses blood brain barrier to cause stimulation. It 
  is a drug of abuse in people. <strong>Pseudoephedrine</strong> is widely available 
  as a cold cure: it does not cross the blood brain barrier in any great amount 
  and causes less CNS stimulation than ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is used as a 
  precursor in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine, so if you prescribe 
  a lot of it, you may attract attention from the police or MoH. All &#945;1 agonists 
  will cause vasoconstriction - check the animal's cardiovascular system before 
  use.</p>
<p><strong>Oestrogens</strong> have many side effects, including bone marrow depression 
  (potentially fatal), attraction for male dogs, pyometra (if any endometrium 
  is left) and mammary carcinomata. Contraindications for oestrogens include pregnancy 
  and oestrogen dependant tumours (unlikely in a spayed bitch): for &#945;1 agonists 
  heart disease.</p>
<p>All oestrogens can be absorbed across intact skin, so handle with care and 
  warn the owner, particularly women and children.</p>
<p><strong>Stilboestrol</strong> was the most widely used oestrogen but is now 
  unavailable in NZ because of worries that it is carcinogenic (however, all oestrogens 
  are carcinogenic). One of the main reasons for spaying bitches is to prevent 
  them developing mammary tumours, oestrogen replacement is likely to negate this. 
</p>
<p>Oestradiol benzoate injection is licensed for use in dogs but is not really 
  practical. Oestrogen tablets are widely available for human use but one preparation 
  (&quot;Premarin&quot;) is widely used because it is a mixture of oestrogen metabolites 
  and not very potent, and it comes in tablets small enough for dogs. Use the 
  lowest dose that works. Oestrogens are rapidly metabolised in the liver; <strong>ethinyloestrenol</strong> 
  is commonly used in women because it is rapidly absorbed and metabolised to 
  oestradiol. It is mainly used as a contraceptive pill: you will have to be prepared 
  toexplain to the bitch's owner why you charged lots of money to spay the bitch 
  and are now putting her on contraceptives. <strong>Oestriol</strong>, a natural 
  oestrogen normally used for HRT in women, has recently come on the market in 
  NZ for dogs. It is claimed not to cause as much bone marrow suppression as oestradiol, 
  probably because it is a much weaker oestrogen.</p>
<p><strong>Testosterone</strong> is sometimes useful in castrated males - mechanism 
  unknown</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="chol"></a>Cholinergics</p>
<p><strong>Bethanecol</strong> is sometimes used to contract the detrusor muscle 
  in urinary retention caused by bladder paralysis after spinal injury. It is 
  now difficult to obtain and tends not to work very well in some cases.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="alAnt"></a>Alpha adrenergic antagonists</p>
<p>Used when urinary retention is caused by excessive sphincter tone, <strong>phenoxybenzamine</strong> 
  (non specific &#945; antagonist) is often given with diazepam to relax the external 
  spincter. Care is required in animals with heart disease. Phenoxybenzamine binds 
  irreversibly to the receptors so tends to last for the lifetime of the receptors 
  (3 - 4 days). More specific drugs such as <strong>prazosin</strong> tend to 
  be used in people.</p>
