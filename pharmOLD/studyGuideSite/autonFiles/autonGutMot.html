<p>Drugs that enhance gastrointestinal motility are valuable in the treatment 
  of delayed gastric emptying, adynamic ileus and other motility disorders in 
  dogs and cats. Drugs which reduce motility are often used to treat diarrhoea. 
  Their use should be reserved for persistent diarrhoea.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="prok"></a>Prokinetic drugs</p>
<p><strong>Metoclopramide</strong> has both antiemetic and prokinetic properties. 
  Although it is a dopaminergic D<sub>2</sub> antagonist, its effects on motility 
  are probably caused by its 5HT<sub>4</sub> agonist activity which, among other 
  effects, increases acetylcholine release. <strong>Cisapride</strong> acts in 
  the same way to stimulate lower oesophageal sphincter tone, gastric emptying 
  and small bowel peristaltic activity, and may be more effective. Cisapride has 
  been withdrawn in the USA because it sometimes causes fatal arrhythmias in people; 
  although it is currently available in NZ, this may not last. However, there 
  is a variety of new 5HT<sub>4</sub> agonists, such as prucalopride, going through 
  clinical trials in people overseas, which may be useful in animals in the future. 
  They appear effective in experimental dogs. 5HT<sub>4</sub> agonists increase 
  colonic motility in dogs and cats and are useful for megacolon in cats.</p>
<p>The antibiotic <strong>erythromycin</strong> can be a valuable prokinetic in 
  dogs and cats when used in low doses. It mimics the effects of the hormone motilin 
  in cats and has a similar but indirect effect in the dog. The dose required 
  is much smaller than the antibacterial dose. Similar macrolides with no antibiotic 
  activity are in development.</p>
<p><strong>Ranitidine</strong>, although usually used as an anti-ulcer drug, also 
  has a prokinetic effect, probably by acting as an anticholinesterase and possibly 
  as a M<sub>3</sub> cholinergic agonist.<br>
  Opioid antagonists which do not cross the blood brain barrier are entering clinical 
  trials in people as prokinetics. They may be useful in dogs and cats in future.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="spasmo"></a>Motility reducing drugs (spasmolytics)</p>
<p>Intestinal transit time is largely determined by the ratio between peristalsis 
  (the driving force for moving intestinal contents aborally) and segmentation 
  contractions which narrow the bowel lumen and increase the resistance to flow, 
  which helps to mix the contents. Theoretically, therefore, motility modifiers 
  could reduce diarrhoea by decreasing peristaltic contractions or by increasing 
  segmentation contractions. In real life, reducing peristaltic activity by drugs 
  such as anticholinergics is of little value for the treatment of diarrhoea. 
  Increased peristaltic activity is usually not the primary reason for the rapid 
  transit of bowel content during acute diarrhoea. Antimuscarinics reduce, but 
  do not abolish, peristalsis and they also reduce segmentation contractions. 
  As long as some peristaltic activity is present, no matter how weak, it can 
  propel liquid contents through a flaccid tube and diarrhoea will occur. Because 
  of their questionable effectiveness and potential to produce adverse effects, 
  such as adynamic ileus, antimuscarinics should not be used for the treatment 
  of diarrhoea. The only role for antimuscarinics is the treatment of abdominal 
  pain resulting from bowel spasm. <strong>Hyoscine</strong> combined with <strong>dipyrone</strong> 
  (Buscopan) is commonly used for this purpose in horses and, to a lesser extent, 
  dogs. It may be better to use a pure NSAID.<br>
  Increasing the resistance to flow of ingesta through the intestine by administering 
  drugs that promote segmental contractions is a more sensible method of prolonging 
  intestinal transit time. In contrast to antimuscarinics, there is good evidence 
  that drugs which work in this way, such as the opioids, effectively slow intestinal 
  transit and reduce diarrhoea without predisposing to adynamic ileus. Opioids 
  acting at &micro; receptors increase the amplitude of rhythmic segmentation 
  and decrease the propulsive contractions. The net effect is to markedly inhibit 
  the flow of intestinal contents, delay gastric emptying, and increase tone in 
  the ileocolic valve and anal sphincter. There are also many &#948; receptors throughout 
  the gut. &#948; agonists help to reduce secretion in people, and possibly dogs 
  and cats. There are interactions between the receptors, and most of the commonly 
  used drugs have some effect at &#948; receptors, although their main effect is probably 
  at &micro; receptors.</p>
<p>Effective opioids include <strong>morphine</strong> and its crude extracts 
  such as <strong>paregoric</strong>; <strong>pethidine</strong>, <strong>diphenoxylate</strong> 
  and <strong>loperamide</strong>. Pethidine also has a short anticholinergic 
  type spasmolytic effect. Diphenoxylate and loperamide are the most commonly 
  used for the treatment of diarrhoea because they do not cross the blood brain 
  barrier to any great extent and so are difficult for drug addicts to abuse. 
  Some opioids, in particular loperamide and to a lesser extent diphenoxylate, 
  also increase fluid and water absorption. Loperamide has a faster onset of action 
  than diphenoxylate and fewer side effects. Atropine is added in small quantities 
  to diphenoxylate to minimize its abuse in humans as the sensation of a dry mouth 
  is unpleasant. The amount of atropine has no effect on the gastrointestinal 
  tract. The major disadvantage to using opioids is their central nervous system 
  depression if used in inappropriately high doses. They are also contraindicated 
  in diarrhoea resulting from infection with invasive bacteria. In these cases, 
  diarrhoea performs an important protective role that helps get rid of the organism. 
  Slowing intestinal transit may prolong the residence time of the bacteria in 
  the bowel, leading to greater opportunity for growth, invasion of the mucosa, 
  and the absorption of toxic products.</p>
<p>Cannabis derivatives, acting at the CB1 receptor, have the same effects as 
  opioids - agonists slow the gut, antagonists speed it up. These drugs are not 
  currently approved in NZ.</p>
