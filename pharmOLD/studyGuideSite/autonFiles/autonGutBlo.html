<p class="footerSG"><a name="def"></a>Definition</p>
<p>Bloat = an overdistention of the rumenoreticulum by gases of fermentation, 
  with or without foam or separated gas. May occur in sheep as well as cattle.<br>
  The three main types of bloat (ruminal tympany) based on aetiology<br>
  &#8226; <em><strong>Frothy</strong></em> (primary) - due to protein breakdown 
  in the rumen<br>
  &#8226; <em><strong>Free gas</strong></em> - gas and low pH<br>
  &#8226; <em><strong>Eructation dysfunction</strong></em> - extra ruminal causes</p>
<p>Most of the info below refers to frothy bloat.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="aet"></a>Aetiology</p>
<p>Animal factors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Diet-A major factor that determines bloat is the composition of the 
    rumen contents (the ruminant's diet) and the rumen microflora. Plant proteins 
    are the primary foaming agent. The rapidity of plant breakdown is a factor 
    in bloat. Adaptation to diet is important, abrupt changes may lead to bloat.<br>
    &#8226; Genetic make up- the predisposition of animals is a known factor. 
    Animals have different specific salivary proteins. Sialoprotein stabilizes 
    the leaf protein, there is less sialoprotein in saliva of susceptible than 
    bloat-resistant cattle.<br>
    &#8226; Rate of saliva production-High vs Low production. Pilocarpine (stimulates 
    salivary secretions) has been used to determine the susceptibility of ruminants 
    to bloat. Animals given pilocarpine that have a higher rate of salivary secretions 
    are less susceptible to bloat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plant factors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; The greater the amount of leafy (legumes) soluble proteins in pasture 
    or hay the greater the risk of bloat.<br>
    &#8226; Tannin-like compounds in plants protect from bloat. Some plants have 
    more of these protective compounds.<br>
    &#8226; The more muco-polysaccharides secreted by encapsulated bacteria (slime 
    producing bacteria) the greater the chance of bloat.<br>
    &#8226; Increased viscosity due to saponins, pectins, hemicellulose and protein. 
    Optimal pH is 6 for maximum stabilization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Environmental factors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Climatic conditions affect the bloat potential of a given pasture. 
    Wet, fast growth, high daily temperatures and cool nights (minimum night time 
    temperatures below 10¾C).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="path"></a>Pathophysiology</p>
<p>The rate of digestion and protein content of the diet are important factors. 
  Legume hay or pasture bloat is different than bloat in grain-fed cattle. Proteins 
  increase surface tension of rumen fluid, increased surface tension allows stable 
  foam production because gas bubbles can not rise or coalesce due to fluid viscosity 
  and entrapment among fine particles at the fluid surface. <br>
  The organization of water (H-O-H, dipole) in the rumen normally requires energy 
  to maintain a surface charge. Proteins lower the energy needed to maintain the 
  surface tension and aid in the entrapment of gas (and thus gas bubbles form).<br>
  Fermentation in cattle produces &gt;25 L gas (methane)/hour, therefore the ruminant 
  needs to eructate to prevent gaseous distention. Free gaseous distension of 
  the cardia portion of rumen stimulates eructation but frothy (entrapped gas) 
  bloat does not.<br>
  Frothy ingesta at neural receptors prevents the reflex relaxation of the cardia 
  during the secondary contraction of the forestomach that ordinarily lead to 
  eructation. Fluid or solid tactile stimulus of cardia decreases eructation. 
  Distention also stimulates the high stretch receptors which in turn inhibit 
  or decrease motility. Therefore frothy bloat decreases motility and eructation.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="signs"></a>Clinical signs</p>
<p><a href="autonGutBloPic.html">photo</a></p>
<p>Distention of left paralumbar fossa; may be difficult to see in sheep due to 
  wool length. Bloat starts within an hour after ingestion of bloat-producing 
  legumes or hay, but typically becomes a problem on the second or third day. 
  Variable!<br>
  Dyspnoea, mouth breathing, protrusion of the tongue and extension of the head. 
  Cardiovascular function is impaired by the pressure on the thorax. Death is 
  due to asphyxiation.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="prev"></a>Prevention</p>
<p>Prevention of bloat relies on the ability of the farmer to predict when forages 
  may pose a risk (tricky!). Types of forage, climatic conditions and animal susceptibility 
  must be considered. Generally, the farmer does not know for certain that a pasture 
  is dangerous until bloat occurs. Then, once prophylactic drugs are used, it 
  is difficult to know when it is safe to stop. Most anti-bloat medications need 
  to be administered one to two weeks prior to the danger period.</p>
<p><strong>Altering Microflora</strong><br>
  Altering ruminal flora can be used as a method to prevent bloat. This is obviously 
  too slow for treatment. The object is to decrease butyric acid, decrease lactic 
  acid and increase propionic acid, therefore rumen pH increases and less methane 
  gas is produced, there are fewer capsulated bacteria and protozoa (they are 
  thought to produce foaming mucopolysaccharides) and there is less tendency to 
  bloat (of frothy type).</p>
<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong><br>
  Monensin is a monocarboxillic acid, polyether ionophorous antibiotic widely 
  used to prevent bloat (and promote growth). It is most commonly used as Rumensin 
  anti-bloat Capsule (Elanco) This is a controlled release intraruminal capsule 
  which is effective for approximately 100 days. A plastic ring prevents regurgitation 
  during the 100 days, but usually within 12 months the capsule will be regurgitated.<br>
  Monensin forms a neutral lipophilic complex with cations and transport these 
  into and through biological membranes (ie, it acts as an ionophore), impairing 
  physiologically normal transmembrane ion gradients. Therefore, Na+ can freely 
  move into cell which results in osmotic injury, and thus reduces the number 
  of protozoa and encapsulated bacteria in the rumen. Changes in the rumen flora 
  result in decreased butyric acid, decreased lactic acid and increased propionic 
  acid production. Monensin is also used as a growth promoter in cattle overseas 
  because of an increase in propionic acid and a decrease in lactic acid production 
  (and decrease in bloat).<br>
  Monensin is toxic in most monogastric species: LD50 Cattle about 20 mg/kg, LD50 
  Horse 2 mg/kg monensin kills horses (nb. it is also the standard coccidiostat 
  in broiler chicken rations - do not let horses get anywhere near these). LD50 
  Dog 2 mg/kg but dogs are unlikely to eat it. The toxicity is potentiated by 
  macrolide antibiotics. Accidents or poor care of mixing machines may result 
  in toxic residues ending up in dog or horse products or cattle feeds at unacceptable 
  levels.</p>
<p>Copper sulphate is sometimes used in sheep for its antibacterial action.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="treat"></a>Treatment</p>
<p>Mild bloat probably requires passing a stomach tube and the use of one of the 
  following remedies such as oil or detergent.<br>
  Acute and severe bloat requires life-saving &quot;heroics&quot; remembering 
  that frothy bloat will not be easily reduced by passing a stomach tube due to 
  the entrapment of gas. Rumenotomy is often a necessity in a life or death situation.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="drugs"></a>Drugs</p>
<p><strong>Oils</strong><br>
  Oils act as &quot;wetting agent&quot;, i.e. they decrease surface tension and 
  destabilize the foam in the rumen. Any edible oil will do, peanut, sunflower, 
  soyabean (Some oils such as turpentine and soya flavour the milk and butter 
  which may result in penalties to the dairy farmer). Do not use fish oils - they 
  stabilise the foam.<br>
  Liquid paraffin is also used as an oral treatment or sprayed on pastures (sometimes 
  added to water in drinking troughs). The duration of action is several hours 
  given a twice daily dose of 60-120 mls for prevention. For long term treatment, 
  liquid paraffin will interfere with carotene absorption and will reduce the 
  carotene and tocopherol content of the butter. Oils are better suited to prevention 
  than to treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Non-Ionic Surfactants</strong><br>
  There are many commercial solutions containing ethoxylated alcohols (poloxamers, 
  polyethylene - polypropylene glycols of various moleculer weights) which reduce 
  or prevent the build up of stable foam and gas in the rumen by decreasing surface 
  tension.<br>
  Ethoxylated alcohols such as poloxalene are surfactants which have a faster 
  action and require smaller doses than oils. They have a duration of action of 
  about 10-18 hours. They are sometimes used in medicated blocks. They should 
  be administered several weeks prior to the &quot;bloat season&quot;. These are 
  the most popular drugs used both in the treatment and prevention of bloat because 
  they are stable and easy to use. Always add the detergent to water.<br>
  These compounds are very safe, and are often also used as emulsifiers in injectable 
  formulations of drugs.<br>
  Silicones such as dimethicone are sometimes used. They are more expensive and 
  are always given orally.</p>
<p><strong>Ionic surfactants</strong><br>
  Ionic detergents such as docusate (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate) were often 
  included with oils to improve their destabilization of foam but have been replaced 
  by non-ionic detergents. They are not used often because of their toxicity - 
  they effectively make the lipds of cell membranes more water soluble - water 
  rushes into the cells and they die. They are especially toxic for calves less 
  than 12 months old, and are not recommended. Failure to rinse buckets adequately 
  before feeding calves can result in toxicity.<br>
  Clinical signs of toxicity include central nervous system signs and diarrhoea. 
  The detergent will dissolve (and thus denude) gut mucosa. The oesophageal groove 
  in calves diverts liquids to abomasum. Even in adult dairy cows, the therapeutic/toxic 
  dose is quite close so take care. These products can cause toxicity in adult 
  ruminants if given directly into the abomasum.<br>
  When used for prevention, surfactants are given every 12 hours or as per manufacturer's 
  recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency treatments</strong><br>
  Alcohol such as whisky or vodka (diluted) might work, but only if nothing else 
  is at hand. Milk or cream may work. Stab release of the pressure in the rumen 
  using a knife or a trochar/cannula is very unlikely to work in frothy bloat 
  - a full rumenotomy is required.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="other"></a>Other types of bloat</p>
<p><strong>Free gas bloat</strong><br>
  This usually occurs in grain fed animals - stomach tube to release gas, or in 
  dire emergency only, use troachar and canulla. The animal will probably have 
  to be treated for acidosis (iv sodium bicarbonate - see fluids notes). Cattle 
  fed on grain are usually also fed a variety of antibiotics to alter rumen flora 
  and reduce lactic acid production - see antibiotics notes.</p>
<p><strong>Abomasal Bloat in Lambs</strong> <br>
  Feeding systems that provide milk replacer to lambs ad lib, i.e. large quantities, 
  infrequently or hand reared lambs. Particularly lambs fed unrefrigerated milk 
  replacer that has been kept at 15¾C or higher twice a day (Refrigerated replacer 
  is not as likely to cause bloating) <br>
  It is thought to be caused by sudden overfilling of the abomasum followed by 
  proliferation of organisms which release abundant quantities of gas. Severe 
  distention causes compression of the thoracic and abdominal viscera and blood 
  vessels. Lambs become distended within 1 hour of feeding and die shortly after 
  distention is clinically obvious. At necropsy, the abomasum is grossly distended 
  with gas, fluid and milk replacer that is usually not clotted. Mucosa is hyperemic.<br>
  Treatment involves passing a stomach tube to relieve gas. Recommend preventative 
  measures to avoid future occurences. Prevention - include 0.1% formalin (37% 
  formaldehyde) to 20% solids in milk.</p>
