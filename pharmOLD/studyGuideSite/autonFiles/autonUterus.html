<p class="titleSG">The uterus</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td rowspan="2" valign="top"><p>The uterine muscle contracts rhythmically. 
        This contraction originates in the muscle rather than being under direct 
        nervous control, and is greatly influenced by circulating <a href="../InfHoFiles/InfHoIndex.html">hormones</a>.</p>
      <p>The effects of drugs on uterine tone depends on the species and stage 
        of pregnancy (although they are rarely used except at parturition). </p>
      <p class="footerSG">Relaxants</p>
      <p><strong>Clenbuterol</strong> (&#946;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist) 
        is used to delay parturition in cows for about 12 hours (very variable) 
        to allow calving to take place at a convenient time of day. It can also 
        be used to relax the uterus for caesarian sections, foetus manipulation 
        in dystocia, embryo transplant etc. <br>
        In growing cattle, clenbuterol will encourage the production of lean meat 
        and lipolysis (sometimes referred to as a partitioning agent). Although 
        this use is illegal in most places (including NZ), clenbuterol is widely 
        abused for this reason in some countries under the name of &quot;angel 
        dust&quot;. It is also abused by human athletes, particularly cyclists 
        for some reason. <strong>Isoxuprine</strong> (also thought to be a &#946;<sub>2</sub> 
        adrenergic agonist) will relax the uterus and is registered for use in 
        cattle.</p>
      <p>Other smooth muscle relaxants sometimes used in women include <strong>nifedipine</strong> 
        (calcium blocker) and <strong>glyceryl trinitrate</strong> (both covered 
        in cardiovascular notes).</p>
      <p class="footerSG">Constrictors</p>
      <p>Drugs which contract the uterus are sometimes used after parturition. 
        <strong>Oxytocin</strong> is a peptide produced by the hypothalamus: uterine 
        contraction will depend on the species and the state of pregnancy (although 
        it is usually used in large animals at the time of parturition when the 
        uterus is most sensitive to its action). Low doses cause regular coordinated 
        contractions, high doses cause spasm. Also causes milk let down. It is 
        used to promote uterine involution and reduce bleeding from the uterine 
        lining and to induce parturition in sows with uterine atony.</p>
      <p><strong>Prostaglandin</strong> F<sub>2&#945;</sub> has been used to cause 
        abortion in bitches (and women). It is a very potent bronchoconstrictor 
        in most species, including people, and must be handled with great care.</p>
