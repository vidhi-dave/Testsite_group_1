<p class="footerSG"><a name="abs"></a>Antibiotics</p>
<p>They have a number of predictable adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract 
  and if injudiciously used will complicate recovery from diarrhoea. Of particular 
  concern is the adverse effects on the normal flora that can predispose the patient 
  to diarrhoea, infection with virulent pathogens and to sepsis. Additional adverse 
  effects of antibiotics include various side effects such as anorexia, vomiting, 
  and iatrogenic diarrhoea that can confuse the clinical picture and delay recovery. 
  Gastrointestinal upset is most commonly seen in dogs and cats as a result of 
  treatment with neomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, penicillins, 
  clindamycin, or chloramphenicol. In horses, tetracyclines are the usual culprit. 
  The diarrhoea resulting from tetracyclines results from changes in the intestinal 
  microflora (often overgrowth of clostridia) and possibly from an irritative 
  effect and may well be fatal in horses and guinea pigs.</p>
<p>Oral aminoglycosides, in particular, should not be administered to animals 
  with diarrhoea unless a susceptible enteric pathogen is strongly suspected. 
  Even then, parenteral therapy is preferred because the aim is to kill the enteric 
  pathogen as it enters the lamina propria. Neomycin can cause a malabsorption 
  syndrome resulting from direct precipitation of micellar fatty acids and monoglycerides 
  or from alteration of microbial flora. Neomycin also appears to interfere with 
  pancreatic lipase activity and decrease bile acid resorption. In addition, aminoglycosides 
  have well recognized renal toxicity, vestibular toxicity, and ototoxicity. The 
  renal toxicity of aminoglycosides is enhanced by youth, dehydration, overdosage, 
  and concurrent administration of certain drugs such as some cephalosporins and 
  nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. These predisposing conditions occur frequently 
  in diarrhoeal diseases. Oral aminoglycosides are often administered in quantities 
  that far exceed the recommended parenteral doses. In normal animals the aminoglycoside 
  is not absorbed, and no systemic toxicity results. In animals with a disrupted 
  intestinal mucosal barrier, however, the absorption of oral aminoglycosides 
  can be increased. In particular, toxic systemic levels can result if repeated 
  oral administration is continued in an animal with decreased glomerular filtration 
  from renal disease or dehydration. Oral aminoglycoside preparations should never 
  be given to dehydrated patients with evidence of a disrupted mucosal barrier.</p>
<p class="footer">Antibioticsare only justified for diarrhoea if:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>bacteria have invaded the intestinal mucosa, from whence they could be a 
    potential cause of bacteraemia or septicemia. Evidence of mucosal invasion 
    includes haemorrhagic diarrhoea (dysentery) and evidence of sepsis such as 
    fever, depression, degenerative left-shifted leucograms, or positive blood 
    cultures. The presence of occasional streaks of fresh blood on the stool is 
    not an indication for antibiotic therapy.</p>
  <p>a known pathogen is cultured from the faeces of the patient, or if firm evidence 
    of a bacterial aetiology is obtained by faecal smears (eg high numbers of 
    clostridial spores), quantitative culture of duodenal fluid (bacterial overgrowth) 
    or intestinal biopsy (eg enteroadherent bacteria). Even in the face of a positive 
    faecal culture, if the animal is not showing evidence of sepsis, antibiotic 
    therapy may not result in more rapid recovery than the provision of supportive 
    care alone. Animals have a large variety of natural defences against bacterial 
    pathogens, not the least of which is floral resistance. Thus, most bacterial 
    enteritis conditions will resolve without antibiotics. In people, antibiotics 
    have been shown to prolong diarrhoea, probably by killing the wrong bacteria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Factors that influence the decision whether to treat with antibiotics-include 
  the type of bacteria cultured, the nature of the clinical signs, and the likelihood 
  of a public health risk from the particular bacteria cultured. Salmonellae and 
  campylobacter are potentially zoonotic, but in people they are not usually treated 
  with antibiotics because this tends to prolong the carrier state without noticably 
  shortening the clinical course of the disease.</p>
<p>Routine usage of antibiotics in non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea is not warranted, 
  in view of the rarity with which enteric pathogens are cultured, the self-limiting 
  nature of many bacterial infections, and the potential adverse effects of antibiotic 
  therapy. Antibiotics of any form are seldom required for longer than five days 
  in the treatment of acute diarrhoea.<br>
  The antibiotic should be chosen after consideration of the spectrum of activity 
  and the concentration of the antibiotic achieved in the bowel lumen, two factors 
  which are prime determinants of the disruptive nature of the antibiotics on 
  normal flora. Ampicillin, and, to a lesser extent, amoxicillin are broad spectrum 
  antibiotics that are highly disruptive of normal flora. These antibiotics should 
  thus be avoided for the treatment of gram negative bacterial pathogens. On occasion, 
  it may be advantageous to use ampicillin or amoxicillin precisely because of 
  their effectiveness against anaerobic flora in the intestinal lumen. For instance, 
  these drugs are indicated in the treatment of patients with clostridial overgrowths, 
  such as are seen in intestinal obstruction.<br>
  Potentiated sulphonamides are good choices for the treatment of enteropathogens. 
  These drugs have broad spectrum activity against invading aerobic and anaerobic 
  bacteria but minimally disrupt intestinal flora.</p>
<p>Fluoroquinolones are also very effective drugs for the treatment of enteropathogens. 
  However, they are the drugs of last resort for treating life threatening Gram 
  negative infections in man , and should never be used to treat diarrhoea in 
  animals.</p>
<p>Gentamicin is useful for gram negative septicaemia in both large and small 
  animal medicine.</p>
<p>Metronidazole is an antimicrobial drug with a very broad spectrum of activity 
  against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. The primary role of metronidazole is 
  in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, anaerobic small intestinal bacterial 
  overgrowth, and peritonitis secondary to bowel perforation. Metronidazole has 
  been superseded by albendazole and fenbendazole as the drug of choice for the 
  treatment of giardiasis in dogs.</p>
<p>Tylosin is an antibacterial agent similar to erythromycin and has been successfully 
  used for idiopathic intractable diarrhoea in small animals and for enteropathogens 
  in large animals. Erythromycin is primarily indicated for the treatment of Campylobacter.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="prePro"></a>Probiotics and prebiotics</p>
<p>Probiotics are defined as live microbial feed supplements which beneficially 
  affect the host animal by improving its microbial balance. While appealing in 
  concept, there is as yet little objective evidence to establish a role for probiotics 
  in the treatment of diarrhoea. Nevertheless, the field of probiotics is an active 
  area of research and recent developments using bacteria that are part of the 
  dominant anaerobic flora of the host, such as Bifidobacterium species, show 
  considerably more promise than Lactobacillus species. Similarly, &quot;prebiotics&quot; 
  (drugs or nutrients - eg fibre - that encourage the growth of normal flora) 
  show considerable promise.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="anth"></a>Anthelmintics</p>
<p>A variety of anthelmentics are used for the treatment of parasitic problems 
  affecting the gastrointestinal tract. In small animals, most parasitic problems 
  can be safely treated with pyrantel with the exception of whipworm infection 
  and protozoal diseases such as giardiasis. To treat whipworm, oxantel (&quot;plus&quot;) 
  preparations are necessary or fenbendazole. Piperazine remains useful for the 
  treatment of ascarids. Giardiasis can be treated with metronidazole, or preferably, 
  albendazole or fenbendazole. See your parasitology notes for more info.</p>
