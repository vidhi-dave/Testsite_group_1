<p class="titleSG">Bronchodilators</p>
<p>Bronchoconstriction produced by chemical mediators in hypersensitivity and 
  inflammatory reactions often is a significant component of respiratory disease. 
  Minor reductions in airway diameter have a marked effect on expiratory effort 
  and frequently result in coughing. To correct or prevent this, various bronchodilators 
  are commonly used in cough mixtures, asthma preparations, or in regimens to 
  treat acute bronchitis and pulmonary oedema.</p>

<p class="footerSG"><a name="adr"></a>Adrenergic agents </p>
<p>Selective &#946;<sub>2</sub> activity produces bronchodilation without significant cardiostimulatory 
  effects. This desirable property is evident in such longer-acting adrenergic 
  agents as salbutamol (albuterol USAN), fenoterol, hexoprenaline, clenbuterol 
  and others. Terbutaline is now difficult to obtain in NZ and its prodrug, bambuterol, 
  is used instead. Common side effects observed with selective adrenergic drugs 
  include nervousness, sweating, muscle tremors, weakness, and vomiting with high 
  doses.<br>
  Adrenaline, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine also possess agonistic properties 
  that are beneficial because the induced vasoconstriction in the bronchi reduces 
  mucosal swelling.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="mx"></a>Methylxanthines </p>
<p>Methylxanthines such as caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine inhibit phosphodiesterase 
  and thereby to relax contracted bronchial smooth muscle cells. &3946; agonists and 
  the methylxanthines work on sequential steps on the same path and it is rational 
  to use bronchodilators from both classes when dealing with a refractory case. 
  The methylxanthines also possess other pharmacological effects that promote 
  bronchodilation, possibly through adenosine receptor blockade.<br>
  Theophylline and several of its derivatives are the most useful methylxanthine 
  bronchodilators. Theophylline itself can be administered PO only, whereas theophylline 
  esters are also available in dosage forms suitable for injection.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="antich"></a>Anticholinergic agents</p>
<p>Anticholinergic agents decrease vagal tone in bronchiolar smooth muscle, and 
  may be useful in certain cases of bronchoconstriction. Atropine has been used 
  for many years for the palliative relief of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
  (heaves) in horses. Atropine and other anticholinergic drugs, such as glycopyrrolate, 
  ipratropium, and deptropine, augment the bronchodilator effects of the adrenergic 
  agents. The reduction in tracheobronchial secretions with an increase in mucus 
  viscosity is a disadvantage of the anticholinergic agents when they are used 
  to treat bronchoconstrictive states. Ipratropium delivered by aerosol is said 
  not to have these side effects.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="gluc"></a>Glucocorticoids </p>
<p>Glucocorticoids may be very beneficial in asthma. They inhibit phospholipase-A2 
  in cell membranes and prevent the formation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, 
  both of which are powerful endogenous bronchoconstrictive substances. The corticosteroids 
  also counteract the effect of histamine and other inflammagens, and enhance 
  the bronchodilator effects of sympathomimetics. Glucocorticoids act to permit 
  b adrenergic induced bronchodilation. Though they should not be used as bronchodilators 
  themselves, the corticosteroids may produce successful responses in chronic 
  refractory allergic respiratory conditions or in lifethreatening bronchoconstrictive 
  episodes.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="decon"></a>Decongestants</p>
<p>Adrenergic &#945;<sub>1</sub> agonists produce vasoconstriction in mucous membranes, which 
  reduces swelling and oedema. These drugs are used topically as nasal decongestants 
  in allergic and viral rhinitis, and systemically as respiratory tract decongestants. 
  The use of decongestants in veterinary medicine is not common. Examples include 
  pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, and naphazoline. Note that 
  pseudoephedrine may cause excitation in dogs at dose rates only marginally higher 
  than therapeutic doses.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="antihis"></a>Antihistamines and other antiallergic 
  drugs</p>
<p>H1 receptor antagonists are commonly included in cough mixtures and cold remedies, 
  and have been employed in the treatment of acute respiratory infections. The 
  role of histamine in hypersensitivity reactions and as an inflammagen is well 
  known, but the routine use of antihistamines for the treatment of disorders 
  of the respiratory system, other than allergic manifestations, is dubious. Some 
  antihistamines exert some central action on the cough centre and may reduce 
  bronchospasm; examples include promethazine and diphenhydramine.<br>
  Sodium cromoglycate is used to control asthmatic attacks in man and to prevent 
  attacks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the horse. It acts by preventing 
  antigen-induced release of histamine and other mediators from sensitized mast 
  cells. Because it is available only as an aerosol of fine particles to be administered 
  by inhalation, it is not often used in veterinary medicine. However, when it 
  is administered to horses using a special nebulizer, clinically normal horses 
  will be protected for 3 -20 days.<br>
  Theophylline is effective as an antihistamine because it inhibits the degranulation 
  of pulmonary mast cells.</p>
<p>Leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 are involved in airway inflammation, the experimental 
  antagonists zafirlukast and montelukast may be clinically useful in the future.</p>
