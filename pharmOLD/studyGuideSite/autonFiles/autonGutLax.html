<p class="titleSG">Laxatives</p>
<p>Laxatives increase frequency of defaecation or soften the faeces making it 
  easier to pass. The first considerations in the treatment of constipation are 
  correction of any fluid and electrolyte imbalance and attention to the primary 
  cause if one can be identified. Chronic use of laxatives requires great care: 
  many of these drugs alter water and ion secretion and can cause problems in 
  long term use, including flatulence and pain as well as ion imbalance.</p>
<p>A lubricating <strong>warm water enema</strong> with manual fragmentation and 
  removal of the hardened stool (under anaesthesia) is valuable in severely constipated 
  animals. A suitable enema solution is warm water mixed with generous quantities 
  of <strong>methylcellulose</strong> lubricant. Phosphate enemas are contraindicated 
  in small animals because of the likelihood of absorption and subsequent intoxication.<br>
  Animals with less severe constipation can be treated by regular warm water lubricating 
  enemas containing soaps such as <strong>docusate sodium</strong> (dioctyl sodium 
  sulphosuccinate). Lubricant laxatives such as <strong>white soft paraffin</strong> 
  and <strong>liquid paraffin</strong> are commonly used in cats and large animals, 
  respectively, although both work in small animals. Syringe administration of 
  liquid paraffin should be avoided in cats and dogs because of the risk of aspiration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beware</em></strong> - the nomenclature of the paraffin series 
  is complicated. They are all mixtures of hydrocarbons with the general formula 
  CnH2n+2 The lightest is paraffin oil (= kerosene), then liquid paraffin (= mineral 
  oil) followed by white soft paraffin (= petrolatum, Vaseline) and paraffin wax 
  (= paraffin). Confusion can arise because liquid paraffin has in the past been 
  called paraffin oil in the USA although its official name there is mineral oil. 
  If you give an animal kerosene in mistake for liquid paraffin you will kill 
  it.</p>
<p>Bulk-forming laxatives are not absorbed from the gut but absorb water and form 
  an emollient gel. The increased volume promotes peristalsis and the stool is 
  kept moist. A variety of natural products such as <strong>psyllium, sterculia, 
  bran and prunes</strong> are effective; <strong>methylcellulose</strong> has 
  also been used. Bacteria in the colon may also break these down to products 
  which exert an osmotic effect, adding to the laxative effect.</p>
<p>Osmotic laxatives are designed to pass through the animal and draw water into 
  the lumen of the gut on the way. It is important that animals are allowed free 
  access to water. Osmotic laxatives should not be given to dehydrated animals. 
  The non-absorbable disaccharide, <strong>lactulose</strong>, is useful in some 
  cats. <strong>Magnesium sulphate</strong> (Epsom salts) is an effective laxative 
  in large animals, but is not usually used in dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Irritant laxatives, such as <strong>anthraquinones</strong> (from rhubarb) 
  and extracts of <strong>senna</strong>, are not used much these days, but are 
  effective. Several vegatable oils also have this effect. They are effectively 
  converted to soaps by intestinal lipases. <strong>Castor oil</strong> is the 
  most irritant, <strong>olive oil</strong> the blandest. <strong>Bisacodyl</strong> 
  is another irritant laxative which seems to have a relatively specific effect 
  on the large bowel. It inhibits glucose absorption, but its exact mecanism of 
  action is unknown. It is also available mixed with soaps as an enema.</p>
