<p>Gastric acid makes ulcers worse and stops them healing; inhibitors of gastric 
  acid secretion encourage their resolution. Many cases of ulcers in dogs are 
  caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although there are many possible 
  causes. <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection is recognised as very important 
  in people and possibly some other species, but its role in the dog is unclear. 
  Drugs used to inhibit acid secretion are often classified into three groups: 
  receptor antagonists that block the interaction of secretagogues with their 
  receptors (eg. anticholinergics, H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists); drugs 
  that act on cellular metabolism to inhibit hydrogen ion secretion (eg. prostaglandins) 
  ; and proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole which inhibit the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> 
  ATPase in the apical parietal cell membrane (<a href="autonGutUlcDia.html">diagram</a>).<br>
  Altering gastric pH will also alter the absorption of many drugs, so H<sub>2</sub>antagonists 
  and proton pump inhibitors can cause many interactions.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="h2ag"></a>H<sub>2</sub>-Receptor Antagonists</p>
<p><strong>Cimetidine</strong> inhibits histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion 
  in dogs and cats). <strong>Ranitidine</strong> is more potent and longer acting, 
  but both work well clinically. <strong>Famotidine</strong> is a newer H<sub>2</sub>-receptor 
  antagonist that has been promoted as being more effective than both cimetidine 
  and ranitidine: studies in dogs have suggested that it is of similar clinical 
  efficacy to ranitidine. H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists cause minimal side 
  effects even at high doses. There is evidence that, at least in people, tolerance 
  to H<sub>2</sub> blockers can develop.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="ppi"></a>Proton pump inhibitors</p>
<p><strong>Omeprazole</strong> irreversibly inhibits the proton pump (H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> 
  ATPase) at the apical border of parietal cells, reducing hydrogen ion secretion. 
  As this is the final stage of the process, omeprazole inhibits acid secretion 
  no matter what secretagogues are present. It is very potent in dogs. A single 
  daily dose can result in virtually no acid secretion. The drug does not affect 
  other gastrointestinal secretion in dogs. Omeprazole is a weak base that is 
  lipophilic at pH 7.4. Once the drug enters parietal cell canaliculi into which 
  hydrogen ions are being secreted it becomes trapped in its active (protonated) 
  form within the cell. When not in an acidic environment, the drug does not accumulate 
  and remains inactive, so once it has increased pH, it has no more effect. Omeprazole 
  is useful in diseases requiring profound inhibition of acid secretion. For instance, 
  in humans and dogs it has been shown to be superior to H<sub>2</sub> blockers 
  for the treatment of severe reflux oesophagitis and the occasional indolent 
  gastroduodenal ulceration. There is a delay in onset of action of 3 - 5 days 
  while the drug accumulates and a similar delay in offset after stopping administration. 
  The drug is safe in dogs and probably in cats, although there has as yet been 
  little clinical experience in cats. Omeprazole inhibits microsomal enzymes to 
  a similar extent to cimetidine. Therefore, when using omeprazole in multi-drug 
  therapeutic protocols, the potential for drug interactions must be carefully 
  evaluated.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="pgs"></a>Prostaglandins</p>
<p>Prostaglandin E analogues inhibit gastric acid secretion, they also have a 
  variety of other beneficial effects (such as improved blood flow and trophic 
  effects) that have proven valuable in managing mucosal lesions (see figure 3). 
  <strong>Misoprostol</strong> is an analog of prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> which 
  is the drug of choice for NSAID-induced ulceration and may have a role in the 
  treatment of stress erosions or ulcers, although it is expensive. Side effects 
  include diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and abortion if pregnant.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="antac"></a>Antacids</p>
<p>Gastric acid can be transiently neutralized with antacids. These drugs must 
  be given at least six times daily to have any benefit in the treatment of gastric 
  ulcers, which makes them impractical in small animal medicine. Less frequent 
  administration may actually result in greater than normal rates of acid secretion 
  (acid rebound), potentially making ulcers worse. Common antacids include <strong>aluminum, 
  calcium, and magnesium hydroxides</strong> or silicates. Aluminum or magnesium 
  containing antacids are probably the most effective. Aluminium-containing antacids 
  tend to promote constipation whereas magnesium-containing antacids encourage 
  looser stools. Aluminum reduces gastric motility and delays gastric emptying. 
  Mixtures of magnesium and aluminium salts are most commonly used.<br>
  <strong>Aluminium hydroxide</strong> reduces phosphorus absorption and can be 
  useful in chronic renal disease.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="mucprot"></a>Mucosal protectants</p>
<p>Mucosal protectants coat the ulcer and protect it from acid and proteolytic 
  enzymes, allowing it to heal.<br>
  <strong>Sucralfate</strong> is the aluminum salt of a polysulphated derivative 
  of sucrose which is used to treat gastric and particularly duodenal ulcers. 
  Uncontrolled trials in dogs and cats with vomiting have suggested a beneficial 
  effect. In an acidic environment, the molecule dissociates into aluminum and 
  sucrose sulphate. The negatively charged sulphate groups bind to the positively 
  charged exposed proteins of disrupted epithelial surfaces, providing a sticky 
  protective barrier against the action of acid and pepsin. Sucralfate inhibits 
  pepsin activity and stimulates bicarbonate and mucus secretion by surface mucosal 
  cells and also appears to reduce parietal cell responsiveness to secretagogues. 
  It also stimulates the release of prostaglandins. Sucralfate is not absorbed 
  from the gastrointestinal tract and has no toxic side effects. Great care is 
  required when using it with other drugs because it reduces the absorption of 
  many drugs including tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and cimetidine. The effectiveness 
  of sucralfate is inhibited (but not completely eliminated) in an alkaline environment. 
  It is common practice to give sucralfate 1-2 hours prior to the use of antacids 
  or drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion.</p>
<p>Colloidal <strong>bismuth</strong> subcitrate and bismuth subsalicylate are 
  useful for the treatment of acute gastritis. Both drugs have been shown experimentally 
  to reduce stress ulceration in rats but bismuth subcitrate has become the compound 
  of choice for upper gastrointestinal lesions whereas bismuth subsalicylate is 
  predominantly used for acute diarrhoeal diseases. Their beneficial effects in 
  gastrointestinal disease have been attributed to their cytoprotective and demulcent 
  properties but bismuth compounds also have antibacterial activity against helicobacter-like 
  organisms (and possibly other bacteria). Bismuth products are very safe when 
  used for short courses at standard doses. Careful dosing is required with bismuth 
  subsalicylate because the salicylate is released by gastric acid and absorbed 
  in the stomach and duodenum. This can cause overdose, particularly in cats. 
  Bismuth subsalicylate is available in various proprietary mixtures; bismuth 
  subcitrate has been used in dogs.</p>
<p>There is little evidence that non-specific gastric protectants, such as <strong>kaolin 
  and pectin</strong>, hasten the recovery of acute ulcers. Any beneficial effect 
  they might have is less likely to be from the coating of ulcers than the adsorption 
  of bacterial toxins. Although traditionally used for diarrhoea, they do not 
  shorten the course of this disease either.<br>
  Atropine and most other commonly used antimuscarinics act on all types of muscarinic 
  receptor resulting in inhibition of acid secretion in people. Pirenzepine (a 
  selective M1 receptor antagonist) inhibits gastric acid secretion without the 
  effects on gastric motility mediated by drugs acting on M2 receptors. None of 
  them appear to be very effective at inhibition of acid secretion in animals, 
  and they also reduce gastric motility, which is undesirable. They are rarely 
  used in veterinary practice.</p>
