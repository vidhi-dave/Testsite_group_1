      <p><strong>Pain</strong>: no completely satisfactory definition exists; 
        that proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (for 
        people) is the most widely accepted: &quot;Pain is an unpleasant sensory 
        and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, 
        or described in terms of such damage.&quot; ie, pain consists of both 
        a sensory component and an affective component. Some people also include 
        a cognitive component, but I consider this a response to pain. (Other 
        people deny that animals are capable of thinking.)<br>
        <strong>Analgesia</strong> = a lack of pain.<br>
        <strong>Nociception</strong> = the sensory component of pain. Since it 
        is not possible to definitively prove that animals can feel pain, this 
        term is sometimes misused (particularly by American physiologists) to 
        mean pain in animals. A nociceptor is a nerve fibre used for pain signals.<br>
        <strong>Hyperalgesia and allodynia</strong> These are conditions which 
        occur after pain perception has been altered by central or peripheral 
        sensitisation. Hyperalgesia occurs when a stimulus which would have been 
        painful before is now more painful; allodynia is when a previously innocuous 
        stimulus (such as light touch) becomes painful. Sometimes these conditions 
        persist after the injury has healed (hyperpathia).<br>
        <strong>Algogenic</strong> = something which produces pain.<br>
        <strong>Placebo</strong> = Latin &#8220;I will please&#8221; = inactive 
        drug given to people who believe that it will do some good.<br>
        <strong>Nocebo</strong> = Latin &#8220;I will hurt&#8221; = inactive drug 
        given to people who believe that it will cause problems.</p>

      and analgesia<br>
      </em>&#8226; pain signals are carried from the periphery to the brain by 
      a number of routes<br>
      &#8226; pain signals are subject to modulation at several stages, particularly 
      in the spinal cord (gating) which may increase or decrease the signal<br>
      &#8226; most analgesic drugs interfere with endogenous pain modulation systems<br>
      &#8226; pain changes over time so drug treatment of pain must change over 
      time<br>
      &#8226; analgesic drugs are more effective if given before the pain starts<br>
      &#8226; good nursing is a useful adjunct to analgesic drugs<br>
