<p class="titleSG">Drugs</p>
<p align="left">By far the most commonly used drug is <strong>lignocaine</strong> 
  (lidocaine USAN). It is chemically stable (can be autoclaved), spreads through 
  tissues, used as 1 or 2% solution parenterally, 4% topically. It has a rapid 
  onset - 5 min, medium duration of action - 30 - 40 minutes (1 hour with adrenaline). 
  Depending on the type of block being used, it is possible to give toxic amounts 
  (maxiumum dose 7mg/kg). It is cheap.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Prilocaine</strong> is very similar to lignocaine but 
  less toxic - used for Bier's blocks (IVRA). <strong>Mepivacaine</strong> again 
  is very similar to lignocaine but less irritant - used in horses for diagnostic 
  nerve block (some horses produce a local inflammatory reaction to lignocaine). 
  <strong>Bupivacaine</strong> is more potent, has a slower onset - 20 minutes 
  but longer action - up to 8 hours. This is useful for post op analgesia. Adrenaline 
  is not usually used with this drug. One of its stereoisomers is potentially 
  cardiotoxic - maximum dose 2mg/kg. <strong>Ropivacaine</strong> is similar to 
  bupivacaine but is much less toxic (and even more expensive).</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Amethocaine</strong> (tetracaine USAN) is the only ester 
  used clinically. It is usually given topically in the eye. <strong>Proxymethacaine</strong> 
  is similar. <strong>Cinchocaine</strong> is sometimes used for spinal blocks 
  but is pretty toxic (it has been used in combination with phenobarbitone for 
  euthanasia). <strong>Benzocaine</strong> is an insoluble local anaesthetic sometimes 
  found in powders applied topically to stop animals itching.<br>
  <strong>Procaine</strong> is obselete - slow onset, poor penetration of mucous 
  membranes, toxic - do not use. The similar <strong>chloroprocaine</strong> may 
  be better but is not available in NZ.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Experimental drugs</p>
<p align="left">Tetrodotoxin (TTX) from puffer fish, blue ringed octopus, etc 
  (produced by symbiotic Vibrio spp) and saxitoxin (STX) from toxic algae are 
  large organic molecules which bind very specifically to (some) sodium channels 
  from the outside and are used to study sodium channels in the laboratory. They 
  are widely used in vitro to block action potentials and are very toxic. They 
  are not used therapeutically, but experimental use shows that they can produce 
  up to 20 hours block in people. They may rarely be seen as poisoning cases (usually 
  saxitoxin - there are probably no blue ringed octopus in NZ).</p>
<p align="left">A variety of obscure spider and scorpion toxins also affect sodium 
  channel gating in such a way as to mimic block clinically - hopefully you will 
  not come across these except in scientific papers.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Sodium channel openers</p>
<p align="left">Veratridine is used experimentally; a variety of insecticides 
  such as DDT and pyrethrums have similar effects. Although not used for their 
  effects in mammals, these are occasionally seen as poisoning cases eg, sea anenome 
  poisoning.<br>
