<p class="titleSG">Inhalation anaesthesia - pharmacokinetics</p>
<p align="left">Different from most drugs in that the inhalation agents are taken 
  up through the lungs and excreted (mostly) unchanged by the same route. (Some 
  of the older agents may undergo significant metabolism.)</p>
<p align="left">A <a href="CNSdigDalt.html">digression on Dalton</a></p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Administration</p>
<p align="left">When inhalation anaesthetics were first used, they were administered 
  by pouring some onto a wad of cotton wool and holding this over the animal&#8217;s 
  nose. Since the effects of these drugs are critically dose dependant, and overdose 
  results in death, precision <a href="CNSgAinhVap.html">vaporisers</a> and complicated 
  anaesthetic circuits were invented to try to control the dose the animal receives. 
  To deliver the correct dose of drug to the animal you must understand how this 
  equipment works (and how to repair it when it doesn&#8217;t)! </p>
<p align="left">Modern precision vaporisers are very accurate but very expensive. 
  In human anaesthesia, there is a trend back towards using simple vaporisers 
  (or even just squirting a bit of inhalation agent in the circuit with a glass 
  syringe) and using sophisticated monitoring equipment to check how much drug 
  the patient is getting. This sort of monitoring equipment is also expensive 
  and is not widely used in veterinary practice.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Uptake and elimination</p>
<p align="left">If animal is healthy, alveolar concentration is proportional to 
  brain concentration, but lung disease will slow the uptake of drug. A number 
  of factors influence uptake and elimination:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><em>physical factors</em> (properties of the drug) (<a href="CNSgAinhTable.html">table</a>)</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="left">&#8226; <strong>saturated vapour pressure</strong> - mainly 
      a factor in vaporiser design unless you use a vaporiser with an anaesthetic 
      for which it was not designed (or a non-precision vaporiser). As vaporisers 
      are very expensive, this is sometimes done but is not recommended. It is 
      useful to express SVP in kPa - this approximates to the maximal concentration 
      you can get out of the vaporiser.<br>
      &#8226; <strong>rubber solubility </strong>- mainly a problem with older 
      agents The drug has to pass through lots of rubber / plastic tubing before 
      it gets into the animal.<br>
      &#8226; <strong>blood brain coefficient</strong> - not clinically significant 
      with current drugs, they all get into the brain very easily.<br>
      &#8226; <strong><a href="CNSbgCoeff.html">blood gas coefficient</a></strong> 
      (solubility) This determines speed of induction and recovery. A relatively 
      insoluble anaesthetic will quickly reach equilibrium between inspired and 
      alveolar concentration, a relatively soluble anaesthetic will take a long 
      time. A soluble anaesthetic effectively has a larger volume of distribution, 
      so more drug has to be absorbed to fill this volume and this takes longer. 
      Therefore a relatively insoluble agent will give a fast induction and recovery; 
      eg, desflurane (BG coeff 0.4; ie insoluble) will give a faster induction 
      and recovery than ether (BG coeff 12; ie soluble). NB., if a drug is completely 
      insoluble it will not get to the brain and will not be an anaesthetic. Soluble 
      drugs tend to be more potent - anaesthesia can be produced at lower concentrations. 
      If this did not happen, they would not be useful clinically as it can take 
      a very long time for them to reach high concentrations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em>other factors</em> (properties of the animal)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&#8226; <strong>ventilation</strong> - in the most extreme 
      case, if an animal is not breathing, it will not take up any drug. (Beware, 
      during intermittent positive pressure ventilation large quantities of drug 
      can be forced into the animal.)<br>
      &#8226; <strong>cardiac output</strong> - again in the most extreme case, 
      if cardiac output is zero, the blood containing the drug will not leave 
      the lungs and systemic uptake will be zero. A low cardiac output will slow 
      the passage from the lungs to the brain.<br>
      &#8226; <strong><a href="CNSgA2ndGas.html">second gas effect</a></strong><a href="CNSgA2ndGas.html"> 
      </a>- probably only important with nitrous oxide. If a large proportion 
      of the volume of the gas in the alveolus moves across into the blood, more 
      fresh gas will move into the alveolus to take its place, bringing more halothane 
      (or whatever) with it. This is a way of getting more halothane into the 
      animal faster, ie, faster induction. This will only happen for the first 
      few minutes - it only takes about 10 minutes for nitrous oxide to equilibrate. 
      The opposite occurs on recovery (Fink effect or diffusion hypoxia) where 
      the nitrous oxide diffuses from the blood into the alveolus displacing alveolar 
      gas (including oxygen); this can give rise to hypoxia. 100% oxygen is usually 
      given for several minutes on recovery from an anaesthetic which has used 
      nitrous oxide.<br>
      &#8226; <strong>lung disease</strong> - thickening of the blood gas barrier 
      in the lungs will slow diffusion. This will mean a slower uptake and elimination 
      of anaesthetic.</p>
