<p>CNS stimulants are occasionally given to animals, but there are practically 
  no indications for them.</p>
<p><strong>Doxapram</strong> is sometimes used as a respiratory stimulant, particularly 
  in new born animals. However, its effects are not confined to the respiratory 
  centre, and it will cause general CNS stimulation (and increased energy requirements). 
  Most respiratory problems in new born animals are caused by airway obstruction: 
  giving a drug which increases cerebral oxygen requirement will make the situation 
  worse. The only indication for doxapram is to counteract the effects of a respiratory 
  depressant drug where it is not possible to perform IPPV for some reason. However, 
  if it is not possible to perform IPPV, you should not be giving respiratory 
  depressant drugs!</p>
<p><strong>Amphetamines</strong> are widely used drugs of abuse in people, and 
  probably in racing animals, particularly greyhounds. There are no indications 
  for them in animals, and it is unethical, and in most cases illegal, to give 
  them to animals (or even possess them).</p>
<p><strong>Methylphenidate</strong> (Ritalin) is given to children in a similar 
  way to behaviour modifying drugs are given to dogs and cats. Its only possible 
  indication in animals is narcolepsy, which is very rare. <strong>Modafinil</strong>, 
  a stimulant with an unkown mechanism of action is also used in people for narcolepsy. 
  There is no experience of its use in domestic animals.</p>
<p><strong>Methylxantines</strong> have a mild stimulant effect, but are usually 
  used for their other effects, particularly on the cardiovascular system. If 
  you need to use a CNS stimulant inan animal, use one of these.</p>
