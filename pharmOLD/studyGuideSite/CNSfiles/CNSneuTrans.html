      <p><strong>neurotransmitter</strong> = a substance released from one neurone 
        and acting rapidly, briefly and at short range on a receptor in the membrane 
        of another neurone. It may cause excitation or inhibition of the postsynaptic 
        neurone.</p>
      <p><strong>neuromodulator</strong> (= neuroregulator) there is no good definition, 
        but they usually act slowly, often at a different site from where they 
        were released. They usually increase or reduce neuronal excitability without 
        causing cells to fire; they may also regulate gene transcription. Most 
        neuromodulators are peptides. As they are well conserved in slimy things 
        they are regarded as being phylogenetically old (but the function of many 
        of them appears to have changed in mammals).</p>
      <p class="footerSG">Introduction</p>
      <p>The CNS is the most complex organ system in the body: the physiology 
        of the normal CNS is not well understood, and most drugs given for their 
        CNS effects are used empirically. Many more drugs have side effects either 
        directly on the CNS or mediated by it. The action of most drugs at the 
        receptor level is known, but this is not always useful in predicting their 
        effects on the whole animal. These notes concentrate on the major transmitter 
        systems where the information is least confusing.</p>
      <p>The effects produced by a neurotransmitter can be very variable for a 
        number of reasons:<br>
        &#8226;the CNS is not hard wired - connections are continually changing 
        under the influence of growth factors. There are usually several back-up 
        wiring systems - the importance of these can change with time and disease. 
        Receptors are being continuously recycled - thus their numbers change.<br>
        &#8226;most neurotransmitters have multiple receptor subtypes at which 
        they can work - so the effects depend on the receptors present on the 
        target cell.<br>
        &#8226;the same receptor subtypes sometimes have different signal transduction 
        mechanisms coupled to different effectors.<br>
        &#8226;their effects can be changed by neuromodulators.</p>
      <p>The good news is that all neurones are thought to obey Dale&#8217;s law 
        and release the same transmitter at all their terminals (but don&#8217;t 
        forget co-transmittors). Calcium is required for neurotransmitter release, 
        so drugs which interfere with calcium movement can alter neurotransmitter 
        function.<br>
        Every neurone has a wide range of inputs (usually both excitatory and 
        inhibitory); what it does will depend on the sum of all these inputs.</p>

      &#8226; the main excitatory transmitter is glutamate acting at AMPA (fast), 
      NMDA (medium) and mglu (slow) receptors<br>
      &#8226; the main inhibitory transmitter is GABA acting at GABAA receptors<br>
      &#8226; neuromodulators act slowly to amplify or reduce transmission, usually 
      by altering membrane polarisation<br>
      &#8226; noradrenaline acting at a2 receptors is mimiced by some important 
      veterinary drugs<br>
