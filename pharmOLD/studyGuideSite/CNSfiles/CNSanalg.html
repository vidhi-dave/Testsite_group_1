<p class="titleSG">Analgesia</p>
<p class="footerSG">Types of pain</p>
<p>The effects of analgesic drugs depend on the pain that they are used to treat. 
  There are lots of different ways of classifying pain; probably the most commonly 
  used in people is to divide pain into nociceptive (ie, in response to a noxious 
  stimulus) and neurogenic (where nerve damage produces abnormal signals which 
  mimic pain signals and there is not any obvious damage to tissues). Different 
  types of drugs are used to treat the two types of pain in man but most types 
  of pain in animals are assumed to be nociceptive. This may change as we learn 
  more about pain.<br>
  Pain can also be classified as somatic, visceral or central. Central pain is 
  assumed to be neurogenic; there is some evidence that visceral pain (eg, colic) 
  is produced by a different mix of neurotransmitters than in the periphery.<br>
  Assessing the intensity of pain, and thus the effectiveness of analgesics, can 
  be tricky. A variety of pain scales have been advocated, which assign numbers 
  (subjectively) to the severity of the pain. Beware statements such as &#8220;drug 
  X is twice as good as drug Y since it halves the pain scale&#8221;.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Management of pain</p>
<p>Successful management of pain requires more than just analgesic drugs. Other 
  tings to be considered include:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>emotional aspects - nursing, food, warmth<br>
    treat the condition!<br>
    physiotherapy??<br>
    TENS? / acupuncture?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If pain cannot be successfully treated, euthanasia must be considered. If an 
  animal's owner refuses analgesia on the grounds of expense. this is the only 
  option.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Groups of drugs</p>
<p>Many drugs have analgesic effects but few are clinically useful. No drug works 
  in every case. The commonly used groups of drugs are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><a href="CNSop-index.html">opioids</a><br>
				<a href="NSAIDindex.html">
    NSAIDs</a><br>
				<a href="CNSlocal.html">local anaesthetics</a><br>
				<a href="CNSseda2.html">
    &#945;<sub>2</sub> agonists</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many other drugs used in people which are less useful in animals 
  (but may be used as adjuvants to one or more of the above drugs):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>psychotropics (mainly used for neurogenic pain in man) - tricyclic antidepressants 
    (TCAs), anticonvulsants<br>
    odds and sods - capsaicin etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">It is often a good idea to use combinations of drugs which work 
  at different sites (balanced analgesia), but more of that later.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Pre op analgesia</p>
<p align="left">Drugs are more effective if given before central sensitisation 
  occurs; ie, before the pain starts (sometimes incorrectly called pre-emptive 
  analgesia). After central sensitisation has occurred higher doses are required. 
  Ketamine may be able to reverse central sensitisation, presumably by blocking 
  NMDA receptors. This means that for surgical pain, animals should be given an 
  analgesic in their premed.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Clinical use</p>
<p align="left">mild pain - NSAIDs<br>
  inflammatory pain - NSAIDs<br>
  severe pain - opioids<br>
  surgical pain - opioids + local + NSAIDs, depending on op<br>
  Analgesia in food animals can cause problems; giving drugs nearly always involves 
  withholding times for meat or milk (as well as cost), but as a vet you will 
  have a responsibility to try to relieve pain. Persuading farmers that animals 
  in pain are not productive may help.</p>
