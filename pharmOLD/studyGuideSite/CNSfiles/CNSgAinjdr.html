<p align="left" class="footerSG"><a name="commonDrugs"></a>Commonly used drugs</p>
<p align="left">Barbiturates, and particularly thiopentone (thiopental USAN: all 
  the barbiturates end in al in American), have always been the drugs most commonly 
  used, although they have recently been overtaken by propofol in human anaesthesia.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="thio"></a><strong>Thiopentone</strong> comes as powder 
  mixed with NaCO3. It is unstable when made up as aqueous solution but keeps 
  for three days in a fridge. It is used as 2.5% solution (pH 11) in most dogs, 
  1.25% in small dogs / cats, 10% in large animals.<br>
  It produces rapid anaesthesia in one circulation time. It is not analgesic, 
  there is some evidence that it is hyperalgesic. It is a potent respiratory depressant. 
  There is usually transient apnoea after an induction dose - ventilate the animal. 
  It produces transient depression (usually only 2- 3 minutes) of cardiac output 
  and blood pressure. It is only used for induction of anaesthesia (cumulation 
  occurs if used for maintenance (half life about 4.5 hours in dogs) - very slow 
  recovery).<br>
  Problems with thiopentone are largely caused by overdosage (see pharmacokinetics 
  above). Muscle relaxation is not always good enough for intubation unless a 
  premed has been given (in people they often use suxamethonium to aid intubation). 
  There are breed variations; greyhounds and similar dogs have a slow recovery. 
  Extravascular injection will cause skin necrosis (high pH, especially more concentrated 
  solutions) - inject lignocaine &plusmn; saline around area. Intra-arterial injection 
  will cause pain, necrosis and possibly convulsions, probably because the thiopentone 
  crystallises out and causes arterial spasm.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="propofol"></a><strong>Propofol</strong> is not a barbiturate but is 
  clinically very similar to thiopentone. It comes as a white emulsion in single 
  use vials under nitrogen which is non irritant (but can cause mild pain in some 
  people, thought to be mediated by P2X receptors). Its major advantage over thiopentone 
  is that it is metabolised quickly in most species (except some cats) (half life 
  about 40 mins in dogs). Its disadvantages are mild excitatory effects (usually 
  front leg paddling in about 10% of dogs, although opisthotonus can occur) and 
  occasionally rough recovery. It can cause hallucinations in people which often 
  takes the form of sexual disinhibition in women! It is expensive, but coming 
  down in price. The vehicle contains egg yolk and coconut oil and is an ideal 
  growing medium for bacteria - open ampoules must be thrown away. There have 
  been some suspected deaths from septicaemia in dogs after using old propofol. 
  Wound infections are three times more likely after propofol anaesthesia - possibly 
  because people are tempted to use old propofol.<br>
  New derivatives of propofol which are water soluble and more potent are being 
  developed.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="alphaxalone"></a>&#8220;Saffan&#8221; (&#8220;Althesin&#8221;) 
  is a mixture of the steroids <strong>alphaxalone</strong> and alphadalone. The 
  alphaxalone is thought to produce most of the anaesthesia, with the alphadolone 
  was originally included to help dissolve the alphaxalone. However, recent work 
  indicates that the alphadolone may have significant analgesic effect. It is 
  a good anaesthetic and is rapidly metabolised, even in cats. However, the vehicle 
  (polyethoxylated castor oil - &quot;Cremaphore EL&quot;) causes massive histamine 
  release in dogs so it is not used in dogs (although a technique of premeding 
  with massive doses of antihistamines has been described - not recommended). 
  Cats sometimes get oedema of the paws and ears after Saffan; the incidence of 
  this can be reduced by injecting the drug more slowly (use a 25 SWG needle). 
  It is only commonly used in cats although it is a good anaesthetic in most species 
  except the dog. Because of its rapid metabolism it can be used for long term 
  anaesthesia / sedation such as intensive care situations. Recoveries can be 
  excitable if the cat is disturbed. Althesin used to be a popular human anaesthesic 
  but was withdrawn a few years ago after similar problems with the vehicle. Saffan 
  is the remaining stocks left after withdrawal of the human drug - when these 
  are used up Saffan may be withdrawn too.<br>
  A new preparation of alphaxalone dissolved in cyclodextrin and water is now 
  available (&#8220;Alfaxan CD&#8221;). This is also suitable for dogs and is 
  likely to be widely used if it compares with thiopentone or even propofol on 
  price.<br>
  Other steroid anaesthetics are under development (although all the candidates 
  so far also cause excitatory effects on recovery). They will be water soluble 
  to avoid the problems with the vehicle.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="ketamine"></a><strong>Ketamine</strong> is rather different 
  from the other induction agents. It is a dissociative anaesthetic, which means 
  (in people anyway) that the patient is conscious but not aware of what is being 
  done to them. This may be because it is a good analgesic and completely blocks 
  the memory! It produces no cardiovascular depression at normal doses. It acts 
  rapidly by any route (although it is painful by im or sc injection - pH4). Its 
  main disadvantage is that is produces no muscle relaxation and can actually 
  cause convulsions in dogs and horses. It is used alone in cats and monkeys and 
  combined with other drugs in other species (see below). It is also abused by 
  some drug addicts, and although it is not (yet) a controlled drug in NZ, it 
  should be locked up. Cats behave strangely for several hours after injection 
  (<a href="CNSketacat.html">movie</a>). <strong>Tiletamine</strong> is a similar 
  drug which comes premixed with zolazepam (benzodiazepine sedative).</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG"><a name="obsolesc"></a>Obsolescent drugs</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Methohexitone</strong> is barbiturate which is similar 
  but shorter acting than thiopentone. It usually produces excitation on induction 
  and recovery - heavy premed required. It produces much more respiratory depression 
  than thiopentone. Its only real indication was for induction in greyhounds but 
  it has been overtaken by propofol. It is now difficult to obtain.<br>
  <strong>Pentobarbitone</strong> is rarely used for anaesthesia any more. It 
  gives a slower induction and is longer acting than thiopentone. Its main use 
  is for euthanasia, although it can be used for anaesthesia in sheep - faster 
  metabolism than most species. It is sometimes used for long term sedation in 
  dogs (eg, metaldehyde poisoning). Do not use euthanasia mixtures for anaesthesia 
  - they are not sterile.<br>
  <strong>Metomidate</strong> and the human analogue <strong>etomidate</strong> 
  are not available in NZ and are mainly of historical interest, although etomidate 
  is currently undergoing a revival in veterinary anaesthesia in the USA. They 
  produce anaesthesia but no analgesia and are traditionally used in pigs. Etomidate 
  may be of advantage in sick dogs since cardiovascular depression is minimal. 
  Analgesic premed is required for a smooth induction, and sedative premed to 
  stop twitching. Etomidate has been abandoned by human anaesthesia because it 
  causes profound adrenocortical depression.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Thiamylal</strong> was used in the USA instead of thiopentone 
  but is no longer available, it was clinically indistuingishable.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG"><a name="obsolete"></a>Obsolete drugs</p>
<p align="left">Laboratory animals are sometimes given these drugs in an attempt 
  to produce long acting anaesthesia with minimal cardiovascular depression. In 
  nearly every case, modern drugs properly administered would be better for the 
  animals and give more reliable results for the experimenter.<br>
  &#945; <strong>chloralose</strong> produces 8 -10 hours of stable light anaesthesia 
  in rodents, but no analgesia. It may have a place in some situations.<br>
  <strong>Urethane</strong> is similar, but has more analgesia. It is carcinogenic. 
  Do not use.<br>
  <strong>Chloral</strong> hydrate in overdose will produce a state bordering 
  on general anaesthesia, but with no analgesia. Do not use.<br>
  <strong>Tribromoethanol</strong> has nothing to recommend it. It must be given 
  ip and is very irritant. It quickly decomposes to even more irritant metabolites. 
  It should never be used.</p>
