<p class="titleSG">NSAIDs clinical uses</p>
<p class="footerSG">Arthritis</p>
<p>Useful in acute joint inflammation to reduce pain and inflammation and allow 
  use of joint. Care must be exercised if their use encourages overuse of structurally 
  compromised joints.<br>
  The progression of chronic cases of arthritis is probably not affected by the 
  use of NSAIDs. However most chronic joint conditions have acute inflammation 
  associated with them to varying extents and it is the acute inflammatory processes 
  responsible for much of the associated pain.<br>
  High concentrations of NSAID will suppress synthesis of cartilage matrix but 
  it is unlikely that the concentrations necessary for this suppression are achieved 
  in most clinical situations. Prostaglandins appear to be involved in the activation 
  of chondrocyte mediated degradation of cartilage matrix and it is more likely 
  in the short to medium term situation that most NSAIDs are potentially chondroprotective 
  when therapeutic concentrations are achieved. However, the possibility exists 
  that some NSAIDs could result in a significant suppression of matrix synthesis 
  if used at high concentrations for extended time periods.<br>
  In people, chronic use of most NSAIDs reduces blood flow to the joints, which 
  is thought to accelerate cartilage degeneration.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Soft tissue inflammation</p>
<p>Used to reduce the acute inflammatory response and to leave the animal more 
  comfortable while natural healing of the tissue injury occurs. The efficacy 
  of NSAIDs is not 100%, therefore the inflammatory process necessary for healing 
  is unlikely to be greatly retarded. Evidence that NSAID use improves outcomes 
  exists for few diseases, e.g. bovine shipping fever</p>
<p class="footerSG">Analgesia</p>
<p><em>Acute pain</em> - onset of analgesia about 15 mins after im / iv injection. 
  Be careful of shock causing hypotension leading to <a href="NSAIDkidDamDia.html">kidney 
  failure</a>.<br>
  <em>Colic</em> - some NSAIDs offer profound visceral pain relief in the horse. 
  Flunixin will give analgesia for 4 - 6 hours and ketoprofen will give similar 
  analgesia for 2 - 3 hours. NSAIDs also relax smooth muscle in the gut; flunixin 
  appears to be most potent. There is a certain amount of evidence that suggests 
  lower dose rates may offer some therapeutic benefit without affecting diagnosis. 
  There have been some cases where the analgesia provided by flunixin was potent 
  enough to hide severe ischaemic damage to the gut which should have been treated 
  surgically. It is probably best to use shorter acting analgesics (pethidine, 
  xylazine) until you have decided that the colic is definitely medical or surgical. 
  Remember the potential for toxicity when large doses are being repeated frequently.<em><br>
  Chronic pain</em> - usually osteoarthritis - dosage regime must be arranged 
  to minimise gastric ulceration. Give tablets with food, only give as necessary 
  rather than continuously, use anti-ulcer drugs.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Endotoxaemic syndromes</p>
<p>NSAID use in endotoxic shock is controversial. NSAID toxicity is significantly 
  increased by a compromised circulation. Combining NSAIDs with high doses of 
  corticosteroids further increases potential for toxicity. NSAIDs have been used 
  for treatment of acute bovine coliform mastitis, colitis X syndrome in horses, 
  agalactia/hypogalactia syndrome in sows and parvoviral diarrhoea in puppies.</p>
