<p><strong>Phenobarbitone</strong> is the drug of choice for dogs and probably 
  also cats. It is the cheapest and most effective. It usually produces sedation 
  and ataxia for the first few days then tolerance develops to these effects. 
  It takes 2 weeks to equilibrate. This is one of the most potent drugs for inducing 
  P450 enzymes - metabolism of phenobarbitone and other drugs is greatly increased. 
  Very rarely, it can cause liver damage.</p>
<p><strong>Felbamate</strong> is a relatively new drug which looks promising in 
  dogs but is still expensive. It has a relatively short half life of 5 - 6 hours. 
  Not available here.</p>
<p><strong>Primidone</strong> has been used in dogs for many years. It is metabolised 
  to phenobarbitone which is probably responsible for at least 85% of primidone&#8217;s 
  effect. Cats don't metabolise it as well so it is less effective. Liver damage 
  occurs after high doses - 70% of clinical cases? Use phenobarbitone instead.</p>
<p><strong>Phenytoin</strong> and <strong>carbamazepine</strong> are effective 
  in man but their half lives are too short in dogs. Phenytoin is teratogenic 
  and can cause liver damage, although a newer analogue, fosphenytoin, may be 
  better. Their main mechanism is sodium channel blockade - use dependent block 
  stops high frequency firing. They induce liver enzymes in about a week - faster 
  metabolism.</p>
<p>Sodium <strong>valproate</strong> has a very short half life in the dog but 
  may work in cats - no enzyme induction. It stops GABA breakdown / reuptake.</p>
<p>The <strong>benzodiazepines</strong> (diazepam) are not much use in dogs as 
  they become tolerant in a few hours - days but may be useful in cats. There 
  are many other benzodiazepine type drugs used in man - most do not work reliably 
  in dogs and cats or are so short acting that they are useless.</p>
<p><strong>Bromide</strong> passes through GABA receptors more easily than chloride 
  and hyperpolarises cells in the same way. It is cheap and is unlikely to kill 
  the dog, but has little else to recommend it. It is effective in about the same 
  proportion of cases as phenobarbitone (~ 70%) but sometimes works when phenobarbitone 
  does not (and vice versa). It has not been used for 30 years in people because 
  of unpleasant subjective side effects but is being revived as a treatment for 
  dogs in the USA. It is ethically dubious to make an animal&#8217;s remaining 
  life a misery with drugs in order to avoid being sued for killing the animal. 
  It should be avoided in cats as it is less effective than in dogs and makes 
  approximately 50% of them cough, which can lead to irreversible lung damage 
  and death.</p>
<p><strong>Gabapentin</strong> and <strong>lamotrigine</strong> are newish drugs 
  which work well in people, but are also metabolised too quickly in dogs to be 
  of much use. <strong>Topiramate</strong> is sometimes used in people. It is 
  supposed to be synergistic with phenobarbitone but there is no experience of 
  its use in dogs.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Combinations</p>
<p>Combinations of older drugs are a last resort - in people these combinations 
  are no better than an adequate dose of one drug. In veterinary practice, combinations 
  of phenobarbitone and bromide (at low doses) are sometimes used. Combinations 
  of phenobarbitone and more modern drugs may be useful, but there is very little 
  information on this as yet. Remember that most anticonvulsant drugs will potentiate 
  anaesthetics, but enzyme innduction will shorten their effect. This can provide 
  nasty surprises.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Drugs which may trigger epilepsy</p>
<p>Avoid phenothiazines and butyrophenones - lower seizure threshold and extra 
  pyramidal effects.</p>
