<p class="titleSG">Inhibitory amino acids</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">GABA</p>
<p align="left">GABA (&#947; aminobutyric acid) is widely used throughout the 
  CNS - virtually every neurone will be inhibited by it. It is mainly contained 
  in short inhibitory interneurones. GABA<sub>A</sub>receptors are a major site 
  of drug action, particularly for sedatives, anticonvulsants and general anaesthetics. 
  GABA<sub>A</sub>receptors are also present on peripheral neurones but what they 
  do there is not obvious. The GABA<sub>A</sub>receptor is a ligand gated ion 
  channel which opens when two molecules of GABA bind to it which causes chloride 
  ions to flow into the cell, causing hyperpolarisation and thus inhibiting firing. 
  Blockade of the chloride channel by experimental drugs and toxins causes convulsions.</p>
<p align="left">As well as binding GABA, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors also bind 
  benzodiazepines (sedatives) and, less strongly, barbiturates (injectable anaesthetics). 
  Both classes of drugs potentiate the effects of GABA by various means and cause 
  postsynaptic inhibition. GABA<sub>A</sub>receptors are probably also the site 
  of action of most anaesthetic agents. Some drugs also bind to the benzodiazepine 
  receptor to stop the channel opening (inverse agonists - do not confuse with 
  benzodiazepine antagonists which only block the effects of benzodiazepines and 
  have no effect on their own). Endogenous inverse agonists are thought to exist 
  but their function is unknown - exogenous ones make animals anxious which is 
  not usually desirable.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="CNSntGABARdia.html">The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor</a> 
  is composed of five subunits, but 19 different subunits have been cloned and 
  there are probably 500 subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub>receptors. Drugs specific 
  for these subtypes are likely to emerge. The use of knockout mice has led to 
  the discovery of the probable involvement of &#945;1 and &#946;2 subunits in 
  sedation, of &#945;2 in anxiety and myorelaxation, of &#945;5 in learning, of 
  &#946;3 in anaesthesia, of &#948; in epileptic seizures etc.</p>
<p align="left">GABA<sub>B</sub>receptors have a presynaptic inhibitory action 
  and may be important in the spinal cord but not much is known about their function. 
  They are G protein coupled receptors. There are probably lots of different subtypes. 
  GABA<sub>C</sub>receptors are chloride channels similar to GABA<sub>A</sub>receptors; 
  they have been studied in the retina but are probably more widely distributed. 
  So far, their function seems to be the same as GABAA receptors.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Glycine</p>
<p align="left">Glycine is also an important inhibitory transmitter, particularly 
  in the spinal cord. It binds to a chloride channel receptor very similar to 
  the GABAA receptor (ie, different from the glycine receptor associated with 
  the NMDA receptor). This is clinically important as strychnine is a competitive 
  antagonist at the glycine inhibitory receptor - in strychnine poisoning, an 
  animal will start to twitch. Tetanus toxin blocks the release of glycine (and 
  GABA) resulting in continuous muscle contraction.</p>
<p align="left">Both the GABA and glycine gated chloride channels are similar 
  to the glutamate gated chloride channels found in invertebrates and which are 
  the target for avermectin parasiticides. In overdose, these commonly used drugs 
  can open GABA and glycine gated chloride channels to cause CNS inhibitory effects 
  in mammals. Avermectins do not usually get into mammalian brains because the 
  P glycoprotein pump in the blood brain barier keeps them out. Some individual 
  animals (particularly collies) are missing the gene for the P glycoprotein and 
  will go into a prolonged coma if given avermectins.<br>
