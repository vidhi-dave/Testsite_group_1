<p class="titleSG">Drugs</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Morphine</strong> is the oldest drug and probably still 
  the best. It is certainly the cheapest. An im dose will last about 4 hours in 
  the dog and horse, and up to 24 hours in the cat, but the duration of action 
  will depend on the pain. Morphine produces less obvious analgesia in ruminants, 
  but works in pigs (short acting - about 1 hour after normal doses). It is not 
  licensed for use in food animals. Intrathecal morphine lasts up to 24 hours, 
  but sometimes produces itching of the areas supplied by the cord segments affected. 
  Use sc or im rather than iv in dogs (histamine release).</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Methadone</strong> is very similar to morphine but more 
  expensive. It is traditionally used in horses because of a myth that it causes 
  less excitement then morphine. It is very long acting in some people, but not 
  in animals. It may cause less vomiting in dogs.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Pethidine</strong> (meperidine USAN) works well in people 
  but is very short acting in most animals (30 - 40 mins in the dog): high doses 
  need to be given often. It is metabolised relatively easily by the cat. One 
  metabolite, norpethidine, can cause excitation in people, usually only when 
  it accumulates in renal disease or when pethidine is given regularly. This could 
  be a problem in animals with renal disease. Pethidine is abused by people because 
  it penetrates the CNS rapidly.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Fentanyl</strong>, <strong>alfentanil</strong> and similar drugs are very potent, short acting drugs mainly used in anaesthesia to cover painful bits of ops or as infusions. Fentanyl <a href="../PKsFiles/PKsPatch.html">patches</a> are sometimes used for longer term analgesia. Carfentanil is similar but longer acting, it is usually used for chemical immobilisation of large animals (including deer). <strong>Remifentanil</strong> is a new short acting drug used in people but 
  there is no experience with it in animals yet.</p>
<p align="left">There are a number of other opioids peculiar to America, <strong>oxymorphone</strong> 
  is widely used there as a substitute for <strong>morphine</strong>, and <b>hydrocodone</b> as a substitute for <b>codeine</b>.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Heroin</strong> (diamorphine) is not used in animals, 
  and only very rarely in people in NZ. It is a drug of abuse. It is much more 
  lipid soluble than morphine and gets into the CNS faster (so works better at 
  producing euphoria), but once there it is thought to be metabolised to morphine 
  and exert its analgesic effects as morphine.</p>
