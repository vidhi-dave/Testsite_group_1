<p class="titleSG">Balanced analgesia</p>
<p class="footerSG">Definition</p>
<p>Balanced analgesia = using several drugs at low doses so that the analgesic 
  effects are additive or synergistic but the side effects are reduced. Combinations 
  usually include an opioid or a2 agonist and possibly an NSAID plus one or more 
  of the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><em>Dissociative anaesthetics</em> - <a href="CNSgAinjdr.html">ketamine</a> 
    is the only drug easily available, tiletamine mixed with zolazepam (a benzodiazepine 
    sedative) could be used. Their analgesic effects only become obvious at anaesthetic 
    doses but ketamine potentiates other analgesic drugs at very low doses. Ketamine 
    is an NMDA antagonist. It stops / prevents wind up in spinal cord and is also 
    amnesic in man (blocks memory of pain). High doses in combination with a2 
    agonists will cause anaesthesia.<br>
    <em>Dopamine antagonist</em>s<br>
    <em>Butyrophenones</em> such as droperidol (usually used as sedatives) produce 
    deep sedation in combination with opioids. Enhanced analgesic effects have 
    been reported but are dubious.<br>
    <em><a href="CNSgAinhDr.html">Inhalation anaesthetics</a> - </em>All cause 
    unconsciousness but some cause profound analgesia at low doses. Nitrous oxide 
    is the most widely used (50% mixture with oxygen is probably the single safest 
    analgesic). Methoxyflurane (not available in NZ) and trichloroethylene are 
    good analgesics at low doses. Their mechanism(s?) are unknown but may involve 
    endogenous opioids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footerSG">Drugs used for chronic pain in man</p>
<p>These may sometimes be useful in animals as part of a balanced analgesic technique.</p>
<p><strong>tricyclic antidepressants</strong><br>
  These block reuptake of noradrenaline and 5HT which then act on a2 and 5HT3 
  receptors in dorsal horn of cord. Amitriptyline works best in man at doses well 
  below the antidepressant dose. It also blocks NMDA receptors at clinical doses, 
  and this may account for its analgesic action.</p>
<p><strong>sodium channel blockers</strong><br>
  These are used for causalgia in people. Lignocaine given intravenously has been 
  used this way in hores, but is metabolised too quickly after systemic administration 
  to be much use. Longer acting sodium channel blockers(see antiarrhythmic drugs) 
  are used in people after testing the effects of iv lignocaine.</p>
<p><strong>topical analgesics</strong><br>
  Capsaicin (the hot substance in chillies) depletes C fibres of substance P - 
  causes burning pain first but then blocks pain for days - months<br>
  EMLA cream - eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (lignocaine and prilocaine) 
  - will penetrate skin to cause analgesia. Used in needle shy children, but also 
  useful for repeated blood sampling etc. Useful in laboratory animals. (see also 
  drugs used in the eye)</p>
<p>Combinations of drugs should be chosen for the circumstances of the individual 
  animal. Pain changes with time: different drugs and combinations may work more 
  effectively at different times. Remember <a href="CNSlocal.html">local analgesia</a>.</p>
<p>The aim of giving combinations of analgesics is to achieve synergy. This is 
  practically impossible to show clinically and very difficult experimentally, 
  partly because there is no widely accepted statistical technique. So far there 
  is only good experimental evidence for synergy between opioids and &#945;2 agonists 
  (but only by the spinal route) and opioids and NSAIDs. This is a hot research 
  area so things will change in the near future!</p>
