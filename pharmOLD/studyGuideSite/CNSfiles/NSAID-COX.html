<p class="titleSG">Cyclo-oxygenase</p>
<p>Cyclo-oxygenase exists in at least two forms:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>COX1 - constitutive - responsible for physiological production of PGs<br>
    COX2 - inducible - produces PGs during inflammation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All currently used veterinary drugs inhibit both (but to different degrees). 
  Since most side effects are caused by inhibition of COX1, drug development is 
  focussing on finding drugs which only inhibit COX2. Carprofen is the only veterinary 
  drug which comes close so far (in dogs), meloxicam is some way behind. Celecoxib 
  and rofecoxib are new COX2 inhibitors for people, but they may not be specific 
  for COX2 in other species - there are big species differences. Deracoxib has 
  recently been licensed for dogs in the USA, so it may soon make it to NZ.</p>
		<p>COX2 inibitors have been shown to increase the risk of death from cardiac disease in <a href="http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/3/281?etoc">people</a>, no info in domestic animals.</p>
		<p>There are major differences in the efficacy of NSAIDs against the cyclo oxygenase 
  enzymes of various species and tissues. This may be due to variable affinities 
  for COX1 &amp; COX2 (this also varies between species).<br>
  Selectivity for COX2 in the dog (although these figures are contentious):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>carprofen 129<br>
    fenamates 15<br>
    meloxicam 3<br>
    phenylbutazone 2.6<br>
    flunixin 0.6<br>
    ketoprofen 0.2<br>
    aspirin &lt;0.3<br>
    Etodolac may be selective for COX2 in horses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Differences in efficacy may also be caused by difference in predominant end 
  product normally generated by the isomerases of different cells e.g. platelets 
  &amp; thromboxane or neutrophils &amp; PGE2 and PGI2; variable penetration to 
  the site of action or different microenvironments which affect drug enzyme affinity. 
  This can be of clinical importance: COX 2 inhibitors increase the risk of thromboembolism 
  by blocking PGI2 but not TXA2.</p>
<p>Some newer products also inhibit the lipoxygenase pathway.</p>
<p>Acetyl salicylate (aspirin) irreversibly inactivates the cyclo oxygenase of 
  platelets (COX 1) by acetylating it. Most other NSAIDs in most cell types bind 
  reversibly and competitively to cyclo-oxygenase.</p>
