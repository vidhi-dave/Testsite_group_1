  <a href="#other">Other effects</a></p>
<p>Toxic doses and effective doses usually overlap. Major side effects include 
  gut ulceration which is common but rarely serious - at any rate in animals. 
  Dogs seem to be more prone to the gut side effects of NSAIDs than most species, 
  possibly because many of the NSAIDs undergo entero hepatic cycling in the dog, 
  but death from gut ulceration following NSAIDs is almost unknown (1200 people 
  a year die from this in the UK - no figures for NZ). </p>
<p>The other major side effect is kidney failure. Inhibition of prostaglandin 
  synthesis in the kidney of a healthy, well hydrated animal is probably of little 
  consequence, and some predisposing factors has to be present.</p>

<p><a href="NSAIDulcerDia.html">diagram</a></p>
<p>This limits the use of most drugs to about 5 days at normal doses. Very common 
  but not usually serious. Normal production of mucus in the stomach depends on 
  PGE2 (produced by COX1), if mucus production is stopped then the stomach acid 
  will cause ulceration. This can be prevented by giving PG analogues or PGE1 
  with the NSAID (gut pharmacology notes).</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="kidney"></a>kidney damage</p>
<p><a href="NSAIDkidDamDia.html">diagram</a></p>
<p>This usually only happens in combination with other factors:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>hypotension / hypovolaemia (shock, poor anaesthesia, etc.)<br>
    chronic kidney failure<br>
    old age<br>
    urinary tract obstruction<br>
    sodium retention eg congestive heart disease </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kidney failure is rare but often fatal. When the mean pressure in the renal 
  artery falls below about 65mmHg there is not enough pressure across the glomerulus 
  for filtration to take place. The body responds by producing angiotensin II 
  which constricts the efferent arteriole to keep the pressure in the glomerulus 
  up, but in the long term, this would reduce blood flow through the kidney and 
  cause ischaemic damage. To stop this, PGE2 causes emergency vasodilatation in 
  the kidney (until blocked by NSAIDs). NSAID induced renal failure can usually 
  be prevented by keeping the blood pressure at normal levels (usually with iv 
  fluids).</p>
<p>The papilliary necrosis associated with NSAIDs is probably caused by interference 
  with COX2, although COX1 may also be involved. COX2 knockout mice die of kidney 
  failure, but of a different sort.</p>
<p class="footerSG"><a name="other"></a>other side effects</p>
<p><a href="NSAIDantThrom.html">increased bleeding time</a> (mainly aspirin)</p>
<p>Although some drugs have specific hepatotoxic effects (eg, naproxen in dogs), 
  idiosyncratic reactions sometimes take this form in dogs. This is probably an 
  immune mediated problem, but is too rare to have been studied properly in dogs. 
  Carprofen has been implicated in some cases of liver failure in dogs in the 
  USA (5.2 cases / 10,000 doses).</p>
<p>Paracetamol produces specific <a href="NSAIDparaToxDia.html">hepatotoxic</a> 
  metabolites, particularly in cats. These toxic metabolites are usually mopped 
  up by glutathione, but liver glutathione reserves can be quickly used up and 
  liver damage results. Acetylcysteine can be given as a source of glutathione 
  but prevention is better than cure - paracetamol is best avoided in both cats 
  and dogs.</p>
<p>Agranulocytosis can occur, especially after phenylbutazone use in dogs, but 
  is very rare.</p>
