<p class="titleSG">Mixed agonists</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes called partial agonists. These drugs were developed 20 - 30 years ago in the hope of producing analgesics which did not produce respiratory depression or addiction potential. They are falling out of fashion because they are no less respiratory depressant than morphine at equianalgesic doses and many of them produce dysphoria rather than euphoria. Most are <a href="CNSopR.html">? receptor agonists</a> and have side effects such as diuresis and occasionally motor effects in people (no information on domestic animals). <strong>Buprenorphine</strong> 
  is probably the only one worth using; it takes about 45 minutes to reach peak 
  effect even after iv injection and lasts 6 - 8 hours in most species except 
  the dog (about 4 hours). It has a higher affinity for the &#956; receptor than 
  naloxone (see below) so its effects can be difficult to reverse.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Butorphanol</strong> is sold in NZ as an analgesic for 
  dogs and horses (and an antitussive for dogs). It frequently causes excitment 
  in horses and should be given with an &#945;2 agonist to provide sedation. It 
  has been withdrawn from human use in most countries because it produces dysphoria, 
  this probably explains its effects in horses.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Etorphine</strong> (M99) is not available in NZ; it is 
  sometimes used overseas in a neuroleptanalgesic mixture (&#8220;Immobilon&#8221; 
  sold for horses, occasionally used in wild animal immobilisation). <strong><img src="images/skullXbones.gif" width="50" height="44">Beware 
  - self injection is likely to be fatal</strong>; several vets have died using this drug. It is a class A controlled drug (see <a href="../lawFiles/lawCDs.html">law notes</a>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tramadol</b> is not usually classified as a mixed agonist, but one of its stereoisomers is a ? agonist (and the main metabolite of this isomer has a higher affinity for the ? receptor); the other isomer is a monoamine reuptake inhibitor. Increased noradrenaline and 5HT have a synergistic effect on analgesia. Tramadol may also act as an NMDA antagonist. There is not much information on its use in animals yet.</p>
