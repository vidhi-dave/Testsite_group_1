<p class="titleSG">NSAIDs - drugs</p>
<p class="footerSG">Analgesia</p>
<p>All NSAIDs have some analgesic effect, but some appear better clinically than 
  others. <strong>Carprofen</strong>, <strong>ketoprofen</strong> and <strong>flunixin</strong> 
  are the drugs most often used for analgesia rather than an anti-inflammatory 
  effect, but analgesia depends on type of pain and situation of use. Carprofen 
  and flunixin have very different effects on PGE2 production but seem to produce 
  similar analgesia.</p>
<p>Older drugs with more analgesic than anti-inflammatory effects include <strong>paracetamol</strong> 
  (acetaminophen USAN) and <strong>dipyrone</strong> (only available here as a 
  mixture with hyoscine).</p>
<p>The distinction between analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects may be less 
  obvious than it would appear from the clinical use of these drugs. Recent evidence 
  indicates that small pain fibres play an important part in the inflammatory 
  response.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Inflammation</p>
<p>There are lots of drugs on the market but none are perfect. They are widely 
  used for arthritis in people and most drug companies produce drugs for this 
  very lucrative market. There are huge individual, species and age variations 
  in both efficacy and toxicity for all NSAIDs. Some of the newer drugs claim 
  to have a much higher potencies. However, it is their potency relative to the 
  incidence and severity of side effects which is important. To date, all studies 
  examining NSAIDs in dogs have shown gut pathology after a single dose at the 
  recommended rate, except perhaps carprofen.</p>
<p><strong>Aspirin</strong> (acetylsalicylate) has been around for a long time 
  in the form of willow bark. It is deacetylated as soon as it gets into the plasma 
  and most of the anti-inflammatory effects are caused by salicylate. Since aspirin 
  is not very soluble, injectable forms are usually the sodium or copper salt 
  of salicylate. Cheap, not very potent but good at producing ulcers. Cats metabolise 
  it very slowly - it is probably best not to give more than one dose to a cat.</p>
<p>The pyrazolones, <strong>phenylbutazone</strong>, <strong>dipyrone</strong> 
  and <strong>isopyrin</strong> have been around since the 1950s. They are no 
  longer used in people since they very occasionally cause fatal blood dycrasias 
  (possible in dogs too), but are still widely used in horses. Phenylbutazone 
  has the reputation of being less analgesic and more anti-inflammatory than the 
  others (dipyrone is the other way around), but the main reason for using them 
  is that they are cheap. Isopyrin is only available mixed with phenylbutazone 
  in Tomanol (they inhibit each other&#8217;s metabolism and so prolong the anti-inflammatory 
  effect). Phenylbutazone has an <a href="NSAIDpk.html">unexpectedly long half 
  life</a> in cattle.</p>
<p><strong>Flunixin</strong> is very widely used. It is a very potent analgesic, 
  anti-inflammatory and ulcerogenic drug.</p>
<p>A variety of propionic acids are used in human and veterinary practice. <strong>Ketoprofen</strong> 
  is used in man and animals, and is similar to, but perhaps less potent than 
  flunixin. <strong>Carprofen</strong> has been used in most species, it is a 
  good analgesic but not so good an anti-inflammatory. <strong>Ibuprofen</strong> 
  and <strong>naproxen</strong> are widely used in people. Naproxen has a <a href="NSAIDpk.html">very 
  long half life</a> in the dog and has killed several; ibuprofen is much better 
  at producing ulcers in dogs than in people.</p>
<p>The fenamates have been used in man and horses for many years. Amongst others 
  they include <strong>mefenamate</strong>, <strong>meclofenamate</strong> and 
  more recently <strong>tolfenamate</strong>. They may have some prostaglandin 
  receptor antagonist activity as well as inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase. Clinically 
  similar to ketoprofen.</p>
<p>The oxicams, <strong>meloxicam</strong>, <strong>piroxicam</strong> and <strong>tenoxicam</strong>, 
  are widely used in people and dogs for arthritis.</p>
<p>There are lots of other drugs used in man but not commonly in animals. <strong>Indomethacin</strong> 
  was for years the most potent cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor available so you may 
  see it mentioned in papers. It is rarely used. The quinolines, cinchophen, quinine 
  and chloroquine are sometimes used in animals because they are cheap - there 
  is no other reason for using them.</p>
<p><strong>Paracetamol</strong> (acetaminophen USAN) is sometimes seen as a cause 
  of <a href="NSAIDparaToxDia.html">poisoning</a>, particularly in cats. Do not 
  use in cats.</p>
<p>Specific COX2 inhibitors such as <strong>celecoxib, parecoxib</strong> and 
  <strong>rofecoxib</strong> are now on the human market. <strong>Deracoxib</strong> 
  has recently been licensed for dogs in the USA, so it may soon make it to NZ. 
  Metabolism in dogs varies markedly with breed, so celecoxib may be difficult 
  to use clinically. They may also impair bone healing.</p>
<p>Dual <a href="NSAIDmechDia.html">COX and LOX</a> inhibitors such as <strong>tepoxalin</strong> 
  and pure LOX inhibitors such as <strong>zileuton</strong> are starting to be 
  used overseas in people.</p>
