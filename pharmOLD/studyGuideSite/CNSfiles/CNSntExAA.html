<p class="titleSG">Excitatory aminoacids</p>
<p align="left">Glutamate (and aspartate) will excite virtually all central neurones. 
  It acts at a variety of receptors, usually named after the experimental drug 
  used to characterise them. Fast depolarisation of postsynaptic neurones is caused 
  by activation of the ionotropic (Na+) AMPA receptor. (The kainate receptor is 
  very similar and is thought to do the same thing, although its distribution 
  in the brain is different.) The <a href="CNSntNMDAR.html">NMDA receptor</a> 
  is also a ligand gated ion channel (Na+ and Ca++) and is an important target 
  of drug action (see below). Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglu) (nine subtypes 
  at the last count) are G protein coupled receptors which tend to modulate transmission 
  both pre and post-synaptically. No useful drugs act specifically at metabotropic 
  glutamate receptors at present but this is likely to change.</p>
<p align="left">Glutamate is released from vesicles in a process that requires 
  calcium. Zn++, and probably other things, are also released from the vesicles.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">NMDA receptors</p>
<p align="left">These are a means of amplifying excitatory signals. They are thought 
  to be responsible for long term potentiation which is the physiological basis 
  of memory. Possibly more important from a veterinary practice point of view, 
  they cause wind up in the spinal cord (and probably the brain stem) which shows 
  up as hypersensitivity to pain (see <a href="CNSPainAnalg.html">analgesia</a>). 
  They are probably also involved in the propagation of seizures in epilepsy.</p>
<p align="left">They are composed of five proteins, usually one NR1 subunit and 
  four NR2. There are several types of NR2 subunits; NMDA receptors containing 
  NR2B subunits are thought to be important in pain and are being targetted for 
  drug development. Having a variety of subunits to choose from when forming NMDA 
  receptors means that many subtyes of receptors are possible, but the clinical 
  relevance of this is not clear yet. The channel pore is normally blocked by 
  Mg++ ions, but these are <a href="CNSntNMDAR.html">displaced on depolarisation</a>, 
  allowing Na++ and Ca++ through the pore. Ca++ sets off a <a href="CNSntNMDAlong.html">series 
  of reactions</a> which can result in long term changes.</p>
<p align="left">Many useful drugs exert their effects indirectly through NMDA 
  receptors, ketamine directly <a href="CNSntNMDARdia.html">blocks the channel</a>. 
  It would be undesirable in most circumstances to completely block (loss of memory) 
  or open the channel (excitotoxicity), so most new drugs coming along are partial 
  agonists.</p>
<p align="left">In most forms of neuronal injury, particularly strokes in people, 
  the mechanism of damage is cells leaking glutamate (from energy metabolism) 
  which then acts at NMDA receptors and lets lots of calcium into the cell. This 
  can kill the cell (excitotoxicty). A drug which could prevent this without side 
  effects would be a huge earner, so there is a lot of effort going into research 
  in this area.</p>
<p align="left">NMDA receptors require glycine to bind to a specific site before 
  the channel can open. In vivo, there is always enough glycine around to allow 
  channel opening, but many potentially useful NMDA antagonist drugs bind to this 
  glycine site. (nb, this is not the same as glycine gated Cl- channels, see below.)<br>
