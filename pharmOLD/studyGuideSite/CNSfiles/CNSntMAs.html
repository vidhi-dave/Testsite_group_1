<p class="titleSG">Monoamines</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Noradrenaline</p>
<p align="left"><a href="CNSntNAupt.html">Noradrenaline</a> is an important (mainly 
  inhibitory) neurotransmitter, usually acting at postsynaptic &#946; or &#945;2 receptors 
  (do not confuse with presynaptic &#945;2 receptors in the periphery). Activation 
  of &#945;2 receptors always causes inhibition of the neurone they are on - if the 
  neurone is presynaptic, as in the periphery, the effects can be excitatory. 
  &#945;2 receptors are important in alertness, sleep, blood pressure control and pain 
  transmission; &#945;2 agonists are widely used in veterinary medicine for their CNS 
  effects (see under analgesics and sedatives). The endogenous ligand for many 
  &#945;2 receptors in the CNS may be agmatine rather than noradrenaline, agmatine 
  also binds to imidazoline and NMDA receptors.</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">5HT</p>
<p align="left">5HT (serotonin) is widely used as a neurotransmitter but because 
  it acts at a large number of receptor subtypes (at least five different types 
  in the brain - which may be either inhibitory or excitatory, pre or postsynaptic) 
  its physiological role is not clear. 5HT neurones are concentrated in the pons 
  and medulla with diffuse connections up and down. It is thought to be important 
  for sleep, some sensory pathways, feeding behaviour, vomiting, mood, etc, etc. 
  Not many veterinary drugs interact with it directly, although the side effects 
  of some are mediated by 5HT.<br>
  In man, depression appears to be associated with a functional lack of noradrenaline 
  or 5HT or both. Depression is not recognised in animals, but antidepressant 
  drugs certainly alter animal behaviour and are often given empirically for this 
  reason. Noradrenaline and 5HT have their action terminated by reuptake into 
  the presynaptic neurone; most antidepressant drugs block this reuptake, eg the 
  tricyclic antidepressants. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors were used in the past 
  for the same purpose but have major side effects. Modern, reversible MAO inhibitors 
  such as moclobemide may be better. Some reuptake inhibitors are more specific 
  for noradrenaline (imipramine) or 5HT (fluoxetine) (or dopamine (selegiline)) 
  but most will block the reuptake of all to some extent. Since these transmitters 
  are also important in the peripheral nervous system, antidepressants have many 
  side effects attributable to excess noradrenaline &plusmn; 5HT (some of the 
  older drugs have antimuscarinic effects as well).</p>
<p align="left" class="footerSG">Dopamine</p>
<p align="left">Dopamine is a neurotransmitter as well as a precursor for noradrenaline. 
  It is involved in three important pathways; nigrostriatal pathway - important 
  in motor control; the mesolimbic pathway to the nucleus accumbens - the &#8220;reward 
  pathway&#8221; and the tuberoinfundibular pathway between the hypothalamus and 
  the pituitary. Problems with the nigrostriatal pathway lead to Parkinson&#8217;s 
  disease in people: this is not recognised in animals but can be induced by dopamine 
  antagonists (many classes of sedatives)! The reward pathway is very important 
  in drug addiction in people, but is probably involved in learning and possibly 
  food intake in animals too. The tuberoinfundibular pathway is important to maintain 
  pituitary secretion (dopamine inhibits pituitary hormone release) - drugs to 
  manipulate this are starting to be used in veterinary practice. Many hormones 
  involved in reproduction are under the control of pituitary derived releasing 
  hormones. <br>
  Dopamine also stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone to cause vomiting and 
  dopamine agonists are used as emetics.<br>
  Dopamine also acts at a large number of receptor subtypes but most known functions 
  are through the D2 subtype family.</p>

  in the brain.</p>
