		<p>1. Your best client brings in Casey, a 3 year old intact female Corgi. She was visiting the neighbour&rsquo;s property and returned with blue-green material on her muzzle. The neighbours were not home to ask about poisons used on their property. Casey appears slightly anxious and restless. Your clients believe Casey would have had access to the poison sometime within the last two hours. What would you do?</p>
		<p>2. The owner of a pet dog calls for advice. The owner&rsquo;s property borders on native bush in a small valley near town. Pest operators have placed a pesticide containing phosphorus in the bush with the result that dead possums have been found in the surrounding area. Barney, a labrador cross, has been seen eating a dead possum. The dog is not showing any clinical signs of toxicity at the time of the phone call. What would you do?</p>
		<p>3. The owner of a working dog calls for advice. The dog disappeared into the bush for about 10 minutes while the farmer was checking stock. When the dog returned it appeared to have been eating a carcass. Pest operators have been using 1080 poison locally for possum control. Assuming that the dog is not currently showing any clinical signs of toxicity and could arrive at your clinic within an hour of ingestion, briefly discuss what advice/information you would give the owner over the phone regarding the dog and justify the advice.  </p>
