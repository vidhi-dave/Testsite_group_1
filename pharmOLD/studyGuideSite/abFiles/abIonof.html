			<p class="ParBodytext">Ionophores are another family of antibiotics produced by various species of <span style="font-style: italic; ">Streptomyces</span>. They are highly lipophilic monocarboxylic acids that are toxic to many bacteria, protozoa, fungi and higher organisms. There are a number of ionophores licensed for use in NZ (<span style="font-weight: bold; ">lasalocid</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">maduramicin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">monensin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">narasin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">salinomycin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">semduramicin</span>). These are mostly fed in large quantities to chickens - vets are usually not involved.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The exterior of their molecules are hydrophobic, and the interior hydrophilic, being able to bind one (uniporters) or more (antiporters) cations. Their lipophilic nature allows them to readily penetrate cell membranes and act as a pore, allowing uncontrolled influx and/or efflux of selected ions, such as potassium and sodium. This uncontrolled ion flow interferes with the osmotic control mechanisms in cells, often leading to cell death. The different drugs transport different ions across the cell membrane: monensin - mainly Na<span class="Charsuperscript">+</span>; lasalocid - Ca<span class="Charsuperscript">++</span> and Mg<span class="Charsuperscript">++</span>, and to a lesser extent, K<span class="Charsuperscript">+</span>; salinomycin and narasin - mainly K<span class="Charsuperscript">+</span>.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Protozoa, mainly <span style="font-style: italic; ">Eimeria </span>spp.in animals, but also <span style="font-style: italic; ">Plasmodium </span>(malaria).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The susceptibility of Gram positive bacteria to ionophores varies according to bacterial cell wall structure. The structure of the cell envelope of Gram negative bacteria appears to influence susceptibility to ionophores through differences in ionophore binding and permeability. They have some effect against Gram positives, importantly <span style="font-style: italic; ">Cl perfringens</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycoplasma</span>, but most Gram negatives are resistant (ionophores do not reach their cell membranes).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">B hyodysenteriae</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Lawsonia intracellularis</span> in pigs can be controlled clinically with ionophores. Monensin has been effecitive against an <span style="font-style: italic; ">Enterococcus</span>-like organism in trout.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The polyene antifungals nysatin and amphoteracin B are also ionophores.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Resistance</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Organisms which produce ionophores have efflux pumps to get rid of the drugs, but the mechanism of resistance in pathogens is unknown.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Increased resistance to ionophores has been reported for <span style="font-style: italic; ">Staphs </span>in pigs and cattle and for enterococci in chickens and pigs. It has also been reported in the rumen bacterium, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola</span> M384, which appeared to have arisen from chromosomal mutation not plasmid transfer, possibly resulting in decreased porosity of the outer membrane.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">There appears to be no development of resistance in <span style="font-style: italic; ">Clostridia</span>.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The effects of the drugs are markedly influenced by the growth media, which adds uncertainty to reports of resistance.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Cross-resistance to other ionophores can occur, but resistance is not complete. Anecdotal evidence of resistance in chickens in NZ is emerging.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Monensin, and probably the other ionophores, is very toxic in low concentration for horses and dogs and in high concentration for cattle (myocardial degeneration). They are also very toxic to people and are not used in this species.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">LD50s mg/kg</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">cattle 22 - 80</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">horses 1 - 2</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">sheep 12</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">pigs 16</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">dog 10 - 20 (bitches lower)</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">chicken 200</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Turkeys, Guinea fowl and Japanese quail are more susceptible than chickens.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Monensin is by far the most widely used, mainly as a coccidiostat. Ionophores are primarily used in broilers, but also in layer replacements, goats, sheep and cattle for prophylactic control of coccidiosis caused by <span style="font-style: italic; ">Eimeria </span>spp. They may also have the useful side effect of preventing necrotic enteritis (<span style="font-style: italic; ">Cl perfringens</span>). They are also used to control swine dysentry and proliferative enteropathy in pigs. Salinomycin is also licensed as a growth promoter for pigs and beef cattle. Monensin is licensed for controlling bloat and ketosis as well as improving food conversion efficiency in cattle.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The improved feed efficiency effects in ruminants is due in part to a increase in the proportion of Gram negative to Gram positive bacteria. However, ionophores also appear to affect Gram negative bacteria, which may either be sensitive at concentrations likely <span style="font-style: italic; ">in vivo</span> and subsequently become resistant, or they may be able to grow but the presence of the ionophore causes altered metabolism. The net result is an increase in the proportion of propionate to acetate, and decrease in rumen ammonia, probably as a result of reduced hydrolysis of peptides, along with less proteolysis and deamination of amino acids in the rumen.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Bloat is a major health issue for grazing cattle, and coccidiosis of major concern to monogastric animals and neonatal ruminants. The effects of coccidiosis are debilitating and can be fatal, either directly or through increased susceptibility to other diseases such as necrotic enteritis, caused by <span style="font-style: italic; ">Clostridium perfringens</span>, in poultry.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Other anti-bloat treatments are available, however, none are suitable for extensively grazed animals. The effect of monensin of reducing methane production and emission by ruminants, a major contributor to the greenhouse effect, could be considered beneficial to the environment.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Human use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Not used in people because of toxicity, but antimalarial use is a possibility in the future.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Interactions</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Monensin reduces the uptake of macrolides into macrophages <span style="font-style: italic; ">in vitro</span>. Ionophores and tiamulin interact to severely retard growth in pigs.</p>
