			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Nitrofurazone</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">nitrofurantoin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">furazolidone</span> are sometimes (rarely) used. They inhibit a variety of bacterial cell enzymes, but the actual mechanism of bacterial cytotoxicity is probably non-specific damage to DNA. This makes them suspect carcinogens and they are banned in food animals in Europe. They will probably be banned in food animals here soon, too.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Nitrofurans are active against many Gram negative and most Gram positive bacteria, including <span style="font-style: italic; ">Staphs</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Streps</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Corynebacterium</span>, coliforms, plus <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycoplasma </span>spp and some protozoa. Resistance is by chromosomal mutation. Plasmid mediated resistance occurs but is rare. <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>and most <span style="font-style: italic; ">Proteus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Enterobacter </span>and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Klebsiella </span>are resistant.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Nitrofurantoin, the only systemically used member of this class, may cause vomiting and diarrhoea, and stains the urine brown. A variety of other systemic, idiosyncratic and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported including blood dyscrasias, hepatotoxicity and pulmonary infiltration.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Nitrofurantoin at recommended doses is absorbed rapidly after oral administration. It does not achieve therapeutic concentrations in the plasma because of very rapid renal excretion. Effective concentrations are achieved in the urine, and it is mainly used for urinary tract infections in dogs and cats, usually after inappropriate treatment has induced an infection resistant to more common drugs. Do not use in renal failure.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Nitrofurantoin is an acid with a pKa of 7.2 and is most active in acid urine, but solubility declines rapidly below pH 5.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Nitrofurantoin is used as tablets (human). Nitrofurazone is used as an antibacterial ointment (in combination with other drugs). Furazolidone is used as a feed additive in pigs and poultry to stop <span style="font-style: italic; ">E. coli</span> / <span style="font-style: italic; ">Salmonella </span>scours - do not use with dinitro.</p>

			<p class="Bodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Novobiocin</span> is an antiquated drug related to coumarin, which has not been used in people for many years because of the high incidence of side effects.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Novobiocin binds to bacterial DNA gyrase and inhibits DNA repair and transcription. The binding site is on a different subunit of the enzyme from that of the fluoroquinolones.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Novobiocin is mainly useful against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Staphs</span>. <span style="font-style: italic; ">Streps </span>are less sensitive, and enterococci and most coliforms are usually resistant, although it may be useful against some strains of <span style="font-style: italic; ">Proteus</span>. It may be synergistic with penicillin. It is also used in combination with sulphanilamide as a treatment for coccidia in poultry. Resistance develops quickly.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Novobiocin often causes vomiting and diarrhoea, blood dyscrasias, and occasionally skin rashes. It is very good at producing allergic reactions in people. It is a substrate for the renal organic anion transporter, which blocks secretion of other drugs and results in high renal concentrations.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Novobiocin is an acidic drug which should not be given with basic drugs such as the macrolides. Novobiocin is available mixed with tetracycline and dexamethasone for dogs and cats, and for formulation with feed or drinking water. Intramammary preparations are available overseas.</p>

			<p class="Bodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Rifampicin</span> (rifampin USAN) is a complex macrocyclic antibiotic sometimes used in horses. It inhibits bacterial DNA-dependant RNA-polymerase in bacterial but not mammalian cells. Similar drugs such as rifabutin are also available overseas.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext"></p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Rifampicin is a very broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic which has limited usefulness because of very rapidly developed resistance - probably a one step mutation modifying DNA-dependant RNA-polymerase. Its most useful applications are in the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy (in man), and the treatment of rhodococcal pneumonia in foals in combination with erythromycin. (Resistance to the combination develops much more slowly). It can be useful against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Staphs</span> in the short term, but must be given with another drug to slow development of resistance.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext"></p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Rifampicin causes body excretions secretions to turn orange. It can cause rashes, and will cause mild alterations to liver enzymes. It is contraindicated in pregnant animals and in those with hepatic injury. The combination with erythromycin can cause fever.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext"></p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Rifampicin is lipid soluble, and 75 - 90% plasma protein bound. It is well absorbed after oral administration. Rifampicin is distributed to most tissues with good penetration into the CNS and body cavities. Rifampicin is useful for treatment of infections caused by intracellular bacteria.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext"></p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Rifampicin is extensively metabolised by deacetylation in the liver (this metabolite also has antibacterial activity). Hepatic failure causes decreased clearance and accumulation.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext"></p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Rifampicin should be reserved for treatment of TB in people. Its only indication in animals is for rhodococcal pneumonia in foals in combination with erythromycin, but even here, azithromycin (a macrolide) on its own may be better.</p>
			<p class="Bodytext"></p>
			<p class="Bodytext">Rifamycins have been advocated for <span style="font-style: italic; ">Staph </span>mastitis since they usually penetrate tissues very well. Rifaximin is licensed for this in Italy, but it is one of the few rifamycins which is unable to penetrate tissues. Irresponsible use of these drugs in this way is likely to increase resistance in human pathogens, particularly TB, for which rifampicin is the first line treatment.</p>
