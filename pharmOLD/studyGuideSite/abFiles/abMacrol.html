			<p class="ParBodytext">These drugs have different chemical structures but are clinically very similar in their pharmacokinetics and spectrum of action. They are all bacteriostatic.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Macrolides include <span style="font-weight: bold; ">erythromycin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">tylosin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">tilmicosin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">spiramycin</span> (less active) which are com﻿mon﻿ly used in animals; <span style="font-weight: bold; ">oleandomycin</span> is sometimes used in people. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Roxithromycin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">clarithromycin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">azithromycin</span> are new human drugs which look prom﻿is﻿ing (better phar﻿ma﻿cok﻿i﻿net﻿ics). Kitsamycin is used in an﻿i﻿mals in Australia.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Lincosamides are chemically different but clin﻿i﻿cal﻿ly identical to macrolides. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Lincomycin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">pirlimycin</span> are used in animals, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">clindamycin</span> in people.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Pleuromutilins are also very similar. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Tiamulin</span> is the only drug used in NZ, but valnemulin is used in Eu﻿rope. This class of drugs is not used in people.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Bind to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit and in﻿hib﻿it peptide chain elongation by inhibition of trans﻿lo﻿ca﻿tion and movement along the mRNA.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The macrolides have recently been shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect - preventing superoxide and cytokine production and stabilising macrophages and T cells. This may be a useful side effect in respiratory and skin infections.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Erythromycin acts as a prokinetic in the bowel by several mechanisms (see gut pharmacology notes).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">These drugs have a narrow spectrum mainly con﻿fined to Gram positive bacteria, including penicillinase producing staphs, but not en﻿te﻿ro﻿coc﻿ci. They are also ac﻿tive against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pasteurella </span>and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Bacteroides </span>spp,<span style="font-style: italic; "> Myc﻿o﻿plas﻿ma </span>spp and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rick﻿ett﻿sia </span>spp. Tylosin and roxithromycin are used clinically against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycoplasma</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Chlamydia </span>and some spirochaetes (<span style="font-style: italic; ">Treponema </span>and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Moraxella</span>). Tiamulin is ef﻿fec﻿tive in swine dysentery (<span style="font-style: italic; ">Brachyspira hyodysenteriae</span>). Most strains are now resistant to tylosin. Erythromycin is effective against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rhodococcus equi</span> in foals. Macrolides (especially eryth﻿ro﻿my﻿cin) are used in people for severe <span style="font-style: italic; ">Campylobacter </span>in﻿fec﻿tions, but resistance is high and in﻿creas﻿ing (par﻿tic﻿u﻿lar﻿ly around Auckland). Roxithromycin and azithromycin have some activity against protozoa such as <span style="font-style: italic; ">Toxoplasma gondii</span>. Lincosamides, particularly clindamycin, have use﻿ful ac﻿tiv﻿i﻿ty against anaerobes.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Resistance</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Chromosomal resistance occurs readily. Plasmid mediated resistance is also common. Resistance usually involves changes to the 50S ribosomal unit which pre﻿vents drug binding. This occurs very quickly with lincosamides and slowest with tiamulin.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Cross resistance amongst the macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin Bs is common but not complete.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Macrolides are generally safe. Some local reactions occur at the site of injection, especially thrombophlebitis after intravenous injection. Horses tend to get gastrointestinal disturbances due to enterohepatic cir﻿cu﻿la﻿tion and the antibiotic effect on the normal flora. Ty﻿losin is contraindicated in the horse for this reason.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Dogs and cats often get gut upsets and vomiting af﻿ter erythromycin (it increases gut motility (see gut notes)).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tilmicosin is cardiotoxic and must not be given iv.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tiamulin in combination with coccidiostats will cause severe growth depression (mainly important in pigs).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Transient deafness has been reported in people.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The macrolides are organic bases. Erythromycin’s pKa is 8.6 and tylosin’s pKa is 7.1 so their action is fa﻿voured by higher pH.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Erythromycin is absorbed poorly after oral ad﻿min﻿is﻿tra﻿tion, but distributes well to many tissues, achieving higher tissue concentrations than plasma. This is es﻿pe﻿cial﻿ly true for bone. Macrolides are also taken up by phagocytes. They do not penetrate the intact blood brain barrier. Ion trapping ensures that macrolides achieve high con﻿cen﻿tra﻿tion in normal milk, but the raised pH of mastitic milk reduces the benefit of this effect.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Macrolides are found in saliva at high con﻿cen﻿tra﻿tions. One product (Stomorgyl) is a combination of the macrolide spiramycin with the nitroimidazole met﻿ro﻿n﻿i﻿da﻿zole. This product is marketed strongly on the basis of saliva penetration.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Macrolides undergo extensive enterohepatic cir﻿cu﻿la﻿tion. They are largely metabolised and only small amounts can be found in the urine or the faeces.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Lincosamides are rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with peak plasma lev﻿els occurring within 2 hours. Clindamycin is better ab﻿sorbed than lincomycin.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Clindamycin is 90 -95% plasma protein bound. It is distributed widely, but is not concentrated in any par﻿tic﻿u﻿lar tissue. It does cross inflamed meninges and passes into bone, achieving about 40% of plasma concentration in these tissues (humans). Liver metabolism produces ac﻿tive and inactive metabolites. Most drug is eliminated by the liver, with only 8 - 20 % being excreted in the urine.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Azithromycin has a very long half life (35h) in cats so is usually given as a single dose.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Erythromycin is acid labile and must therefore be administered as enteric coated tablets, or parenterally. Estolate and stearate salts are used to enhance absorption. Newer macrolides such as roxithromycin have been de﻿signed to overcome this problem.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tylosin is available as a powder for mixing with drinking water. This is used especially in the poultry in﻿dus﻿try. Tylosin is also available as parenteral preparations in some countries. It has been banned in Europe as a growth promoter.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">cattle</span> - <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pasteurella</span> pneumonia (rare in NZ although almost ubiquitous in feedlots in the USA)</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">pigs </span>- treating and preventing respiratory in﻿fec﻿tions (pleuropneumonia and enzootic pneumonia) and dys﻿en﻿tery (especially tiamulin).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">chickens </span>- chronic respiratory disease caused by <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycoplasma</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">small animals</span> - skin infections, osteomyelitis, anaer﻿o﻿bic infections, (toxoplasmosis)</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">horses</span> - <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rhodococcus</span> pneumonia in foals (azithromycin), otherwise best avoided</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Human use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Erythromycin has traditionally been used as a subtitute for penicillin in people who are allergic to penicillin. It was also used to treat <span style="font-style: italic; ">Campylobacter</span>, but overuse as part of a protocol for <span style="font-style: italic; ">Helicobacter </span>means that many strains of <span style="font-style: italic; ">Campylobacter </span>in NZ are now resistant.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Azithromycin is usually reserved for chlamydial infections, but has been used in antimalarial combinations with chloroquine. Clarithromycin has some effect against TB, and is included in some protocols for multiresistant TB.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">The future?</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The 3-ketolides are a new related group of drugs which look promising. Telithromycin has been licensed for human use overseas and appears effective against eryth﻿ro﻿my﻿cin resistant <span style="font-style: italic; ">Strep pneumoniae</span>.</p>
