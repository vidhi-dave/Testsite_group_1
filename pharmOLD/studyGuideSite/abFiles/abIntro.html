			<p class="ParSubhead2">Definitions</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Antimicrobial drugs = drugs which kill or inhibit the growth and replication of micro-organisms in living tissues.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Antibiotics = naturally synthesised substances secreted by living organisms, usually bacteria or fungi, to inhibit other species. Commercially, some antibiotics are now partially synthesised (ie, the organism is fermented with different substrates to those found in nature to produce different antibiotics) or completely synthesised chemically. These drugs are often called semi-synthetic or synthetic antibiotics. Although this chapter is concerned with antimicrobial antibiotics, other antibiotics are used as anthelmintics and anti-cancer drugs.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Antiseptics = non selective toxic chemicals which are safe enough to be applied to skin to kill micro-organisms, but not safe enough to be given orally or parenterally (see skin pharmacology notes). Just to confuse things, some antibiotics fall into this category, eg, polymixins.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">The term antibiotic is used in this chapter to cover all antibacterial drugs given systemically or topically except antiseptics.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Classification of antibiotics</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">There is an enormous range of antibacterial drugs available. In order to make sensible decisions about their use, it is helpful to divide them up into groups of similar drugs. Antimicrobial drugs can be classified in different ways, each of which is useful clinically for different reasons:</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">spectrum of activity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">bactericidal or bacteriostatic</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">mechanism of action</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">chemical family</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">toxicity</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Many antibiotics act at bacterial cell walls or cell membranes. This means that the spectrum of activity often corresponds with Gram staining. This approach to classification is not always applicable, however, since there are organisms which are not easily classified by their Gram staining characteristics.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">The antimicrobial drug may have a broad spectrum of activity (i.e. is active against a wide range of different bacteria) or narrow spectrum (i.e. is active against only a few bacteria or one or two families of bacteria). Usually, drugs are classified as broad spectrum if they are active against both Gram positive and Grain negative bacteria.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">examples:</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">broad spectrum</span> - tetracyclines, some cephalosporins, potentiated sulphonamides, fluoroquinolones, some semi-synthetic penicillins e.g. amoxycillin, ampicillin</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">narrow spectrum, Gram positive</span> - macrolides, lincosamides, older penicillins e.g. benzylpenicillin,</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">narrow spectrum, Gram negative</span> - aminoglycosides</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">You must know an antibioticâ€™s spectrum of action in order to treat animals rationally. This is rote learning you just have to do. Bear in mind that as resistance develops, the spectrum will change!</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Bactericidal or Bacteriostatic</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Bactericidal drugs kill bacteria; bacteriostatic drugs stop them growing and rely on the animalâ€™s immune system to get rid of them. However, in reality, the differentiation is not very useful since all you can realistically expect is to influence the competition between the animal and the bacteria in favour of the animal.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Bactericidal drugs can be defined as those for which the reasonably achievable tissue concentration (break point) is greater than the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the great majority of susceptible pathogens. They can be (but are not always) bacteriostatic at lower concentrations or against other pathogens.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Bacteriostatic drugs are those for which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is less than the break point. Nominally, these drugs merely inhibit bacterial cell growth or replication. At very high doses they may be bactericidal. The rational use of bacteriostatic drugs requires the animal to have a competent immune system.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of antibacterial action</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The main usefulness of knowing the mechanism of action of an antibiotic is that is helps to predict the spectrum of activity and the likelihood of inducing toxicity with many of the drugs. It is of major importance if combinations of drugs are to be used.</p>
						<p class="Parsubhead3">Inhibition of cell wall synthesis</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">To be effective, these drugs require the bacteria to be actively dividing. Therefore, combination with protein synthesis inhibiting drugs tends to antagonise the action of the cell wall synthesis inhibitors.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Because mammalian cells do not synthesise cell walls, these drugs tend to be non-toxic. Bacitracin is an exception to this, and is extremely nephrotoxic. It is only used topically.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">eg: penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin, bacitracin</p>
						<p class="Parsubhead3">Disruption of cell membranes</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Since these drugs lead to the rupture of the bacterial cell, they tend to be rapidly bactericidal. They are not dependent on bacterial replication or growth, and can therefore be combined with other drugs to broaden a spectrum of antimicrobial therapy.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Because mammalian cells have a cell membrane which is similar to that of the bacteria, these drugs tend to have either a narrow therapeutic safety margin, or are too toxic to use other than topically.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">eg: polymixin B, colistin, novobiocin, nystatin, amphotericin B</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Most antiseptics / disinfectants / detergents also disrupt cell membranes.</p>
						<p class="Parsubhead3">Inhibition of protein synthesis</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">These drugs are selective for bacteria because bacterial ribosomes (where the proteins are made) are different from mammalian ribosomes. Most of these drugs are bacteriostatic.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">eg: aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincomycin, chloramphenicol</p>
						<p class="Parsubhead3">Inhibition of DNA synthesis / function</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">For these drugs their toxicity tends not to be related to their mechanism of action, and varies with each individual drug. Drugs which interfere with mammalian DNA are potentially carcinogenic.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">eg: sulphonamides ± trimethoprim, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, griseofulvin</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Chemical structure</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Drugs of the same chemical family usually have the same mechanism of action, so there are only subtle differences between this classification and that of mechanism of action. Classifying drugs by chemical family is most useful to the drug manufacturer and medicinal chemists. This method is marginally useful to clinicians, since bacterial resistance to an antimicrobial drug is often shared with other drugs of the same chemical family.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Nephrotoxicity is common to many antibacterial drugs. Those which cause damage to the renal tubular epithelial cells include aminoglycosides, polymixins, tetracyclines and some of the older cephalosporins. Damage to the collecting ducts and more distal tubular structures can be caused by sulphonamide crystalluria.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Liver damage can be caused by tetracyclines, erythromycin and possibly potentiated sulphonamides.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides, polymixins and tetracyclines can result in neuromuscular blockade, especially when anaesthetics are present. Of more clinical significance, however, is the ototoxicity of aminoglycosides, which can cause both deafness and/or vestibulocochlear injury. CNS excitement can be associated with the use of procaine salts of penicillins. This is due primarily to the procaine.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Gut problems are commonly caused in the horse and guinea pig by ampicillin, lincomycin and clindamycin upsetting the normal balance of gut flora. This manifests as pseudomembranous colitis or diarrhoea which is potentially fatal.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Bone marrow toxicity is a feature of chloramphenicol, sulphonamide and trimethoprim toxicity. In dogs this results in an anaemia or panleucopaenia which is reversible by withdrawal of therapy.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Drug interactions are a feature of giving antibiotics. Drugs which inhibit hepatic mixed function oxidase enzymes can significantly reduce the elimination of chloramphenicol and tetracyclines, resulting in toxicity. Some diuretics, especially frusemide, significantly increase the chances of inducing nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides or some obsolete cephalosporins.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">Acute hypersensitivity reactions are possible with many antibiotics. Penicillins can cause anaphylaxis, and the horse seems to be a species particularly prone to hypersensitivities, although most reactions to procaine penicillin are probably to the procaine. Care should always be taken with intravenous injections of antibiotics - monitor the animal for potential hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">And finally...</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">In these notes, the antibiotics have been grouped by their mechanism of action: ie, the bacterial processes with which they interfere.</p>
						<p class="ParBodytext">The use of particular drugs for any given disease in animals is largely empirical rather than being based on good evidence of efficacy and safety. Commonly used drugs will change their status according to the latest fashion!</p>
