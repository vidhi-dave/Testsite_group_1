			<p>The sulphonamides were the first group of completely synthetic antimicrobial drugs (ie, strictly speaking they are antibacterials rather than antibiotics). They are rarely used alone these days because of resistance. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sulphadiazine</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">sulphamethoxole</span> are often mixed with trimethoprim (dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, see next section) to form <span style="font-weight: bold; ">co-trimazine</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">co-trimoxazole</span>. Mixtures with baquiloprim are sometimes also used. There is not much difference between sulphonamides except in solubility and pharmacokinetics.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p>The pyrimidine thymine is a necessary precursor for DNA synthesis. In the absence of thymine or thymidine in the media, bacteria are able to synthesise pyrimidines from the precursor para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), through the folic acid cycle. In the absence of thymidine, inhibition of its synthesis results in inhibition of cell replication, growth, and DNA repair. (Mammalian cells get their folate as a vitamin from food.)</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides act by competitively inhibiting the incorporation of PABA into folate. Since it is a competitive inhibition, the presence of large amounts of the substrate PABA reduces the efficacy of these antimicrobial drugs. Also, if the bacterial media contains thymine, or thymidine, these can be used for DNA synthesis directly and sulphonamides will have little effect.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p>These are broad spectrum antimicrobial drugs, but the spectrum has been compromised by widespread resistance. They are primarily bacteriostatic against Gram positive bacteria, excluding <span style="font-style: italic; ">Staphs.</span> Sulphonamides are also effective against many types of protozoa such as coccidia. The combination with trimethoprim or baquiloprim is bactericidal.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides may be effective in treatment of infections by <span style="font-style: italic; ">Streptococcus </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Salmonella </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">E. coli</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pasteurella </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Shigella </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Actinomyces</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Nocardia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Chlamydia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Toxoplasma</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Plasmodium</span> but the effect is not reliable because of resistance (see below).</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Resistance</p>
			<p>Chromosomal resistance develops slowly, but rapidly induced plasmid mediated resistance is commoner. Possible mechanisms: reduced drug penetration, increased production of PABA or reduced sensitivity of dihydropteroate reductase.</p>
						<p>Resistance is widespread and severely limits the use of sulphonamides - they must be potentiated with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors in most cases to be effective. There is complete cross resistance among sulphonamides.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides are inactivated in pus, which can lead to a lack of clinical efficacy.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p>Older forms of sulphonamide were less soluble and often crystallised out in the urine. With newer drugs this is less of a problem. Nevertheless, patients must be adequately hydrated to ensure dilute urine.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides often cause hypersensitivity reactions. Sulphonamides or potentiated sulphonamides are the main cause of adverse drug reaction in people in NZ. Their use in people is rare now for this reason. Photosensitisation or rashes, blood dyscrasias and hepatopathies occur, but are usually reversible by stopping the drug. These probably occur in animals too but are not noticed.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides can cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca in dogs after prolonged administration (mechanism unknown but probably immune mediated). Immune mediated polyarthritis has been reported in Dobermanns.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides in ruminants can cause suppression of ruminal flora. Prolonged treatment can reduce vitamin K production leading to haemorrhage (especially in poultry).</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides can also cause thyroid supression (cf propylthiouracil - a sulphonamide). Reduced thyroid hormone production causes increased TSH secretion which can cause thyroid tumours.</p>
						<p>Combination with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors mean that much smaller doses need to be given, which reduces the incidence of all but hypersensitivity side effects.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p>With the exception of some drugs which were synthesised particularly for use in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract (and are thus not absorbed, e.g. sulphasalazine, sulphaguanidine, phthalysulphathiazole) sulphonamides are absorbed well and rapidly after oral administration.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides are distributed rapidly to all tissues, including the eye and the cerebrospinal fluid. There are differences in distribution between drugs, and sulphadiazine is best distributed to the CNS.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides are weak acids, and are therefore more active in acidic environments.</p>
						<p>Free sulphonamides and hepatic metabolites (acetylated derivatives) are eliminated by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Longer acting forms achieve their lower clearance by being more highly protein bound and by being reabsorbed by the renal tubule.</p>
						<p>Acetylation of sulphonamides increases the chances of crystalluria. The extent of acetylation is greatest in man &gt; ruminants &gt; horse &gt; cat. The dog does not acetylate sulphonamides. Of the two most commonly used sulphonamides (in preparations with diaminopyrimidines; see below) in those species which acetylate sulphonamides, sulphamethoxazole is more likely to cause crystalluria than sulphadiazine.</p>
						<p>Sulphonamides are often classified on the basis of the pharmacokinetics, specifically half life:</p>
			<p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Short acting</span></p>
			<p>sulphanilamide</p>
			<p>sulphacetanide</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">sulphadiazine</span></p>
			<p>sulphadimidine (=sulphamethazine)</p>
			<p>sulphafurazole (=sulfisoxazole)</p>
			<p>sulphachlorpyridazine</p>
			<p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Medium acting</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">sulphamethoxazole</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Long acting</span></p>
			<p>sulphamethoxypyridazine</p>
			<p>sulphadimethoxine</p>
			<p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Ultra long acting</span></p>
			<p>sulphadoxine</p>
						<p>This classification must be kept flexible because of species differences.</p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sulphasalazine</span> is sulphapyridine complexed with salicylic acid. It is sometimes used in chronic large bowel disease where bacteria break down the complex. It is thought that the salicylic acid probably produces all the useful effects.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p>Sulphonamides are often formulated as sodium salts to increase their solubility. Monosodium salts are very irritant to tissues, and must be given iv only. Disodium salts can be given im, ip etc.</p>
						<p>The â€œlaw of independent solubility&quot; means that the presence of one drug in solution does not affect the solubility of another drug. However, the antimicrobial action of the different sulphonamides is additive. Therefore, combination of several sulphonamides together can reduce the dose of each, thereby reducing the potential for toxicity, without compromising the antibacterial efficacy.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Drug interactions</p>
			<p>B vitamins and their precursors (and related amino acids such as methionine) antagonise sulphonamides. Some drugs such as procaine have PABA as a major metabolite and will do the same.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Use</p>
			<p>Sulphonamides on their own are really only (ab)used to treat scours in calves and piglets. Potentiated sulphonamides are still amongst the most commonly used broad spectrum antibiotics in veterinary medicine - they are cheap!</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Human use</p>
			<p>Not used much any more because of side effects. Even so, sulphonamides and trimethoprim account for over half of all drug adverse reactions in NZ.</p>
						<p class="ParSubhead2">Similar drugs</p>
			<p>Other sulpha-like drugs include sulphones, e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">dapsone, sulphoxone</span>. These are bacteriostatic or bactericidal to <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycobacteria </span>spp. They are used in people for leprosy, but have been used in cows for mastitis and have the same spectrum of activity as sulphonamides. Concerns about residues mean that they should not be used in food animals (dapsone is potentially carcinogenic).</p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sulphamylon</span> has been used topically to prevent infections of burns.</p>
