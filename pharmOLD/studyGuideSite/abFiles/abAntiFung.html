			<p>Probably the most commonly encountered fungal disease is ringworm, which is usually treated with griseofulvin systemically, although a variety of topical agents are sometimes used. Other topical infections include candidiasis and some cases of otitis externa, natamycin or nystatin are usually used for these. Clotrimazole is sometimes used for other superficial infections. Systemic fungal infections are rare but potentially life threatening, the imidazoles are usually used, although amphotericin is sometimes still used because it is cheaper. The imidazoles have superseded the other drugs in human medicine but are relatively expensive since long courses of treatment are often needed for fungal infections. In human medicine, resistance is starting to emerge as a problem - this has not happened in veterinary medicine yet.</p>
			<p>A variety of other substances can inhibit fungi to some extent, these are often seen as poisoning cases after home cures for ringworm have gone wrong!</p>

		<csobj csref="../../../pharmTox.data/InDesignPackages/8 antibiotics/Assets/Stories/story_FFE/story_FFE.incd" h="415" occur="10" t="Component" w="846" g="" s="styleDefs=external,styleURL=/*URL*/'../../8 antibiotics Accessories/styles/styles.css',styleUsage=yes,contentUsage=component">
			<p>Griseofulvin is microtubular toxin which inhibits mitosis. Inhibits growth rather than killing fungi, so has to be given for a long time. (nb duration of treatment needs to be longer with some species of dermatophytes eg, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Microsporum</span>, than others, eg, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Trichophyton</span>). It is deposited in keratin precursor cells and concentrated in the stratum corneum of skin, hair and nails, thus preventing fungal invasion.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p>Fungal infections, particularly ringworm. It is probably toxic to many other cell types, including mammalian.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p>Teratogenic, therefore contraindicated in pregnant animals. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Warn female owners about handling the drug</span>. Diarrhoea, depression and anorexia have been reported. Sometimes damages liver.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p>Griseofulvin is variably absorbed after oral administration. Absorption is markedly enhanced by fat in the gut, so it is recommended to give griseofulvin with a fatty meal. Most absorbed drug is inactivated in the liver (first pass effect) and an inactive metabolite is excreted in the urine. Induction of mixed function oxidase enzymes increase this inactivation.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p>Griseofulvin itself induces hepatic mixed function oxidase enzymes, resulting in altered kinetics of other drugs.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Indications</p>
			<p>Ringworm</p>

		<csobj csref="../../../pharmTox.data/InDesignPackages/8 antibiotics/Assets/Stories/story_F61/story_F61.incd" h="661" occur="46" t="Component" w="846" g="" s="styleDefs=external,styleURL=/*URL*/'../../8 antibiotics Accessories/styles/styles.css',styleUsage=yes,contentUsage=component">
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Amphotericin B</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">natamycin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">nystatin</span> are polyene antibiotics active against fungal pathogens. They bind to ergosterol, the main sterol of fungal cell membranes (analogous to cholesterol of mammalian cells) and thereby disrupt the spatial configuration of the phospholipids, creating an hydrophilic channel through the membrane. The consequent leaking of potassium results in cell death.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p>Amphotericin B is usually active against: <span style="font-style: italic; ">Candida </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Histoplasma capsulatum</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Coccidioides immitis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Blastomyces dermatitidis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Aspergillus </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mucor </span>spp., and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rhizopus </span>spp. It may also have some antiviral effect.</p>
			
			<p>Nystatin is usually active against: <span style="font-style: italic; ">Candida </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Histoplasma</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Cryptococcus neoformans</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Coccidioides immitis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Blastomyces</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Trichophyton </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Epidermophyton </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Microsporum </span>spp.</p>
			
			<p>Natamycin is mainly used for <span style="font-style: italic; ">Malassezia </span>and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Candida </span>infections. It is also active against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Trichomonas</span>.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p>Amphotericin is a highly nephrotoxic drug, causing distal renal tubular damage resulting in loss of urine concentrating ability, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Red and white blood cells, albumin and tubular casts appear in the urine. Plasma creatinine and K<span style="vertical-align: super; ">+</span> levels should be monitored daily. Clinical signs of poor tolerance include vomiting, diarrhoea and depression. Therapy for toxicosis includes withdrawal of treatment. Flucytosine is sometimes given with it as they are synergistic and the amphoteracin dose can be reduced.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p>Amphotericin B is highly lipophilic, and therefore has a large volume of distribution (it is not distributed to the cerebrospinal fluid - intrathecal injections are necessary to achieve therapeutic concentrations). It is slowly released from lipid membranes, and therefore has a protracted mean residence time. The elimination phase half life for this drug can exceed 15 days.</p>
			
			<p>Nystatin is too toxic for parenteral use. Almost none is absorbed after topical or enteral administration. The oral route is used for treating intestinal candidiasis, which can occur after cancer chemotherapy.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p>Amphotericin B must be reconstituted with 5% dextrose, or water. Once reconstituted it is only stable while refrigerated for up to 7 days. The daily dose is administered in 5% dextrose by intravenous infusion over 4 to 6 hours. Usually the drug is given every second day until a total dose is achieved.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Indications</p>
			<p>Amphotericin - systemic fungal infections. A nasty drug - avoid if possible</p>
			<p>Nystatin - topical and gut (<span style="font-style: italic; ">Candida</span>) infections</p>
			<p>Natamycin - fungal otitis (<span style="font-style: italic; ">Malassezia</span>)</p>

		<p class="titleSG"><a id="azoles" name="azoles"></a>Azoles</p>
		<csobj csref="../../../pharmTox.data/InDesignPackages/8 antibiotics/Assets/Stories/story_FA6/story_FA6.incd" h="666" occur="57" t="Component" w="846" g="" s="styleDefs=external,styleURL=/*URL*/'../../8 antibiotics Accessories/styles/styles.css',styleUsage=yes,contentUsage=component">
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">itraconazole</span> are synthetic imidazoles or triazoles, whose structure is similar to the benzimidazole anthelmintics. (Thiabendazole is used as an antifungal in the food industry.)</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p>The azoles inhibit the specific cytochrome P450 enzyme of the fungi which demethylates lanosterol, the precursor of ergosterol, thereby inhibiting ergosterol synthesis. Ergosterol is necessary for normal cell membrane integrity. In mammalian cells this inhibition results in suppressed cholesterol synthesis, but mammals are able to utilise dietary cholesterol, whereas fungi are obliged to synthesise their own ergosterol. Furthermore, compared to fungal sensitivity 600 x concentrations are needed to inhibit mammalian cholesterol synthesis.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p>Azoles have a broad antifungal spectrum of activity. They are usually active against: <span style="font-style: italic; ">Candida </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Trichophyton </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Epidermophyton </span>spp., <span style="font-style: italic; ">Microsporum </span>spp. <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pityrosporum </span>spp. Azoles are either fungistatic or fungicidal, depending on dose.</p>
			<p>Imidazoles (but not triazoles) also kill <span style="font-style: italic; ">Nocardia</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rhodococcus</span>.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p>Miconazole and clotrimazole are only used topically, where they occasionally cause local irritation.</p>
			<p>Ketoconazole can cause anorexia, vomiting and depression. Cats are more sensitive than other species. Avoid in liver disease - hepatic enzymes may be mildly elevated. Ketoconazole inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes, and may lead to accumulation of other co-administered drugs, through inhibition of their hepatic clearance. It is sometimes used deliberately to inhibit the metabolism of expensive drugs such as cyclosporin.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p>Almost none is absorbed after topical administration. Topical administration for fungal infections of nails is unlikely to be beneficial because of poor penetration into this tissue.</p>
			
			<p>Ketoconazole is absorbed well after oral administration, however this absorption is dependent on an acid environment. Histamine H2 blockers, such as cimetidine, will impede the absorption of ketoconazole. It is highly protein bound (80%) and is poorly distributed to the central nervous system.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p>Miconazole, fluconazole and clotrimazole are available in a variety of topical preparations. Ketoconazole is available as tablets for oral use.</p>
			
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Indications</p>
			<p>Systemic mycoses (ketoconazole, itraconazole), ringworm (miconazole, fluconazole), nasal aspergillosis (clotrimazole, itraconazole), severe yeast otitis (clotrimazole).</p>
