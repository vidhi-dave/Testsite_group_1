			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Chloramphenicol</span> has been around since 1948, and is still used despite various concerns. Thiamphenicol is very similar (including all the nasty side effects); it is still used in some European countries. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Florfenicol</span> is a fluorinated analogue of thiamphenicol with major advantages. It has more or less replaced chloramphenicol in most circumstances in veterinary medicine since it lacks most of the side effects. Other derivatives are under development.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Chloramphenicols bind to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit and inhibits peptide chain elongation by inhibition of peptidyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for peptide bond formation.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Chloramphenicol is bacteriostatic against most Gram negative bacteria except <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>spp. It is also active against many Gram positives, anaerobes, the important <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rickettsia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Chlamydia </span>and some mycoplasmas.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Resistance</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Resistance in Gram negative bacteria is plasmid transmitted and is caused by a specific chloramphenicol acetyltransferase which rapidly breaks the drug down. Florfenicol is reasonably resistant to this enzyme. Resistance in Gram positives is caused by a variety of plasmid transmitted acetytransferases. Decreased permeability and decreased sensitivity of ribosomes may also occur. Resistance in <span style="font-style: italic; ">E. coli</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Salmonella </span>used to be widespread, but has reduced with decreased use of the drug (1999 - 4.8% of <span style="font-style: italic; ">E. coli</span> isolates from man resistant). Some bacteria, such as <span style="font-style: italic; ">Salmonella </span>Typhimurium DT104, show multiple resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including chloramphenicol. These resistance genes are usually passed on as a bunch.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">In animals, chloramphenicol can occasionally cause aplastic anaemias, leukaemias and thrombocytopaenias, which are reversible after withdrawal of the drug. It can also cause gastrointestinal upset, both directly and through interference with the normal flora. In cats, vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia are not uncommon. It has caused superinfections.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The veterinary use of chloramphenicol has been severely restricted as a result of a scare caused by anecdotal reports of a non-dose dependent, irreversible aplastic anaemia in man. This is a fatal condition which is idiosyncratic. On examining the evidence, the WHO found that the overall incidence of chloramphenicol associated aplastic anaemia was less than 1 in 10,000,000 (WHO Technical Report 851, 1995. Evaluation of certain veterinary drug residues in food.) However, because of the scare, chloramphenicol was banned in food producing animals for any reason (although it is still used in people). It remains banned in spite of a lack of scientific evidence that it is harmful. Its use should thus probably be limited to life- or sight-saving applications in companion animals. Owners should be adequately warned to avoid exposure.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Chloramphenicolâ€™s outstanding lipid solubility ensures its distribution to all body compartments including cerebrospinal fluid and the eye. Brain tissue concentrations exceed plasma concentrations.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Chloramphenicol is glucuronated in the liver to an inactive conjugate, but there is no obvious first pass effect, with equivalent oral and intravenous doses achieving approximately the same maximum plasma concentrations. Maximum plasma concentration after oral dosing occurs at about 2 hours.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Approximately 90 - 95% of chloramphenicol is excreted in the urine as the water soluble glucuronic acid conjugate and the remainder as the parent drug. A small amount of the inactive conjugate may be found in the bile. Alterations to hepatic microsomal enzymes may alter the elimination rate of chloramphenicol, and result in accumulation to toxic levels. Chloramphenicol also inhibits hepatic mixed function oxidase enzymes (cytochrome P450s) and may therefore cause accumulation of other drugs being co-administered, eg, phenobarbitone, phenytoin. Elimination is very rapid in horses, slow in cats. Accumulation can occur in cats.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Dogs and cats - ointment for eye infections.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Florfenicol has the potency and spectrum of chloramphenicol, but without the toxicity (the main side effect is anorexia). It is unaffected by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, so is active against some chloramphenicol resistant bacteria. It is sold as an injectable solution for respiratory infections in cattle, but should not be used in bulls as it causes testicular atrophy in most species (at high doses).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">It was developed in the USA for <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pasteurella </span>pneumonia which had become resistant to penicillin from overuse. Its role in NZ, where this sort of pneumonia is rare, is not yet clear. It can also be used as eyedrops in horses and companion animals.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Human use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Chloramphenicol is used as an ointment for eye infections and as an antibiotic of last resort.</p>
