			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Streptomycin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">dihydrostreptomycin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">neomycin</span> (a mixture of neomycin A, B and C), <span style="font-weight: bold; ">gentamicin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Framycetin</span> (neomycin B) are used in animals. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Amikacin</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">tobramycin</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">netilmicin</span> are used in people. Kanamycin and sisomicin are obsolescent human drugs. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Paromomycin</span> is occasionaly used to treat <span style="font-style: italic; ">Cryptosporidia</span>.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-size: 9.00pt; ">nb. Gentamicin and netilmicin are spelt differently from the others because they are derived from different fungi (<span style="font-style: italic; ">Micromonospora </span>rather than <span style="font-style: italic; ">Streptomyces</span>).</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The related antibiotics, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">spectinomycin</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">apramycin</span> are usually classified as aminocyclitols. They are similar in most respects to aminoglycosides.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides bind tightly to the 30S ribosomal subunit, and block peptide synthesis by preventing tRNA attachment, blocking normal initiation, and distorting the codon arm to cause mismatching of the codon-anticodon couples. This latter action results in the production of so-called &ldquo;nonsense peptides&rdquo;. Penetration of the cell (and thus activity) is greatly aided by drugs which interfere with cell wall synthesis such as &szlig;-lactams.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides are rapidly bactericidal against Gram negative aerobic bacteria, and have some useful activity against Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as staphs. Streptomycin is also active against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycobacterium bovis</span> and tuberculosis in people. Gentamycin, tobramycin and the newer aminoglycosides are effective against <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>spp.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria because uptake requires oxygen dependent transport processes.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Synergism with penicillins and cephalosporins can occur in some circumstances, and is probably due to damage to cell walls allowing penetration of the aminoglycoside. This is especially useful to extend the spectrum of activity of aminoglycosides to include Gram positive bacteria. However, they are usually chemically incompatible, so do not use home made mixtures.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Resistance</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Resistance to aminoglycosides develops relatively quickly, either by chromosomal mutation or by acquisition of plasmids. Resistance is caused by enzymes which degrade the antibiotic, alterations to the ribosomal binding protein, or of bacterial permeability to the antibiotic. Some bacteria have broad spectrum resistance to the aminoglycosides, others are specific for an individual drug. Gentamicin is most likely to develop resistance; amikacin is least likely. Thus cross resistance is likely but difficult to predict. Adaptive resistance has been demonstrated with the aminoglycosides. <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>develops resistance relatively quickly, staphs more slowly and coliforms very slowly.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Two toxic syndromes are clinically important:</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">renal proximal tubule epithelial cell injury</span> resulting in acute renal failure (This is the major limiting factor on their use in veterinary practice.)</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-style: italic; ">vestibular and / or cochlear injury</span> resulting in cranial nerve VIII signs.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">All aminoglycosides can cause renal damage, especially if pre-existing renal disease exists, or if the animal is dehydrated, or if aminoglycosides are given with frusemide. Serial monitoring of serum creatinine is recommended. Therapeutic drug monitoring is valuable. Care should be taken to allow plasma drug levels to fall to troughs less than 2 mg/ml for several hours each day. Toxicity is associated with high trough drug levels more than with high peak drug levels. In practice, once a day dosing with its peaks and troughs is safer and just as effective as maintaining steady plasma levels by more frequent dosing - peak concentration is what counts for killing bacteria rather than time above MIC.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Deafness may be irreversible. Dihydrostreptomycin and amikacin are most likely to cause ototoxicity.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides can also cause competitive neuromuscular blockade, especially when given with anaesthetics or other NMJ blockers.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides are organic bases and are more active at higher pH. They are very polar at plasma pH and are therefore distributed only to body water. They do not penetrate cell membranes and are not absorbed to any great extent after oral administration.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Parenteral administration results in rapid absorption and distribution. Aminoglycosides are cleared from the plasma rapidly by glomerular filtration, but are accumulated by the renal proximal convoluted tubule cells, and may persist in the kidneys for months after a single injection - <span style="font-weight: bold; ">residues</span>!</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Since antibacterial efficacy depends on peak concentration reached and kidney damage depends on the time allowed for elimination between doses, it is now usual to give gentamicin in a high dose once daily rather than a small dose three times daily as used to be recommended.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Neomycin is too toxic for parenteral use (although available in NZ!), and is only used in topical preparations or orally for gastrointestinal &ldquo;sterilisation&rdquo;.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Sulphate salts improve solubility, but solutions tend to be quite acidic, so may sting when administered im or sc and when given iv must be diluted and given slowly.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides are falling out of favour because of residues (food animals) or toxicity (companion animals). Gentamicin is still widely used in horses. Although its spectrum of activity is mainly Gram negative, gentamicin is sometimes useful for &szlig;-lactamse producing staph infections. It is also the drug of choice to treat <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>infections.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Aminoglycosides are widely abused in young food animals to treat diarrhoea. Calves and piglets with diarrhoea need fluids, not antibiotics.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Lots of streptomycin is sprayed on apple trees and tomatoes in NZ to treat fireblight and bacterial wilt, although this practice is on the decline since it was banned in Europe.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Human use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">A variety of the newer aminoglycosides are important in treating serious Gram negative infections. Streptomycin went out of fashion because it made people deaf, but is becoming important again as part of a multiresistant TB combination.</p>
