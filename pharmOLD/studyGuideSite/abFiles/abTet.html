			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Oxytetracycline</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">chlortetracycline</span> are used in food animals. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Doxycycline</span> is sometimes used in small animals: it has better penetration of tissues and binds calcium less tightly than the older drugs. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Minocycline</span> is similar. Tetracycline itself is not used in animals, although a mixture with lysine, lymecycline is available for use in people.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines inhibit aminoacyl-transfer-RNA from binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit-mRNA complex, thereby inhibiting peptide elongation. Tetracyclines enter Gram negative bacteria by passive diffusion through protein pores in the outer bacterial membrane, followed by active transport across the cytoplasmic membrane. This active transport is lacking in mammalian cells, so although tetracyclines inhibit mammalian protein synthesis, therapeutic concentrations are insufficient to affect the mammalian cell. Entry of tetracyclines into Gram positive bacteria is less well understood, but it is known also to involve active transport.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Spectrum of activity</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">These drugs have a very broad spectrum including Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycoplasma</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rickettsia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Chlamydia </span>and protozoa. (doxycycline is the drug of choice to treat <span style="font-style: italic; ">Haemobartonella felis</span>). Tetracyclines are moderately active against anaerobes. They are relatively poor at inhibition of growth of <span style="font-style: italic; ">Proteus </span>spp. and <span style="font-style: italic; ">Pseudomonas </span>spp. Overuse has led to resistance, and they are not as clinically useful as previously. Their main use is for <span style="font-style: italic; ">Rickettsia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Chlamydia </span>and some protozoal infections.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Resistance</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Resistance to one tetracycline almost always crosses over to all others of this class. Acquired resistance is common. Resistance is conferred by altered permeability / uptake and through production of drug inactivating enzymes.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Doxycycline is used in people for malaria resistant to other drugs; there may well be pressure put on vets not to use it.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="Parsubhead3">Clinically relevant problems</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">All tetracyclines, but particularly doxycycline, can cause a fatal enterocolitis in horses and are contraindicated, except in cases of rickettsial disease. (They are still widely used in horses in practice though).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are deposited into the calcifying areas of growing teeth, and growing bone, causing a yellow staining. They also cause temporary cessation of bone growth. Tetracyclines cross the placenta, and can have these effects in the foetus. Therefore, tetracyclines are contraindicated in young or pregnant animals.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Depression and vomiting can occur in most species as direct gastrointestinal effects. Gut disturbances associated with imbalances of the normal flora are also common, especially in ruminants. Supra infections can occur and pseudomembranous colitis has been described.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are very bitter tasting, and therefore can cause profuse salivation in cats simply due to the taste (as with other bitter drugs). Warn clients that this may occur. Coated tablets are preferred and tablets should not be broken before administration to cats.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="Parsubhead3">Rare problems</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Photosensitisation and rashes can occur, especially with doxycycline, although it has also been recorded after oxytetracycline in sheep in NZ.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Cardiovascular collapse can occur after intravenous administration, particularly in cows, probably due to sudden chelation of the plasma ionised calcium.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines can induce fever: drug related fevers can cause confusion when treating infections.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Old tetracyclines beyond their use by date can cause serious renal proximal tubule mal/reabsorption disorders Fanconi-like syndromes. This is caused by a breakdown product.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines can inhibit hepatic drug metabolising enzymes.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Long courses of tetracyclines can lead to vitamin B deficiencies through inhibition of gut flora. For this reason some tablet formulations are combined with supplementary vitamin B.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines can interfere with matrix metalloproteinases and interfere with collagen formation and contraction. Care required in foals.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are amphoteric, ie they have both negative and positive charges, although they usually behave as weak acids. They distribute rapidly to all tissues, with good penetration of difficult tissues such as prostate and bone. This is especially true for minocycline and doxycycline, which are highly lipid soluble and distribute to the cerebrospinal fluid quite well. Tetracyclines cross the placenta and distribute to all tissues within the foetus.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are absorbed quickly but incompletely after oral dosing: most absorption is from the stomach and duodenum. Bioavailability by the oral route is approximately 0.5. They are unstable in acid (except minocycline). Intramuscular injection usually causes irritation (and pain), although this can depend on the vehicle, and absorption can be variable (but see below).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are easily chelated by divalent cations, particularly calcium, making them insoluble and unavailable for absorption. They should be administered at least an hour before food or antacids. Doxycycline&apos;s absorption is much less effected by foods and divalent cations.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are protein bound in plasma from 60% (tetracycline) to 95% (doxycycline). They are eliminated by glomerular filtration resulting in 20 - 60% being found unchanged in the urine. They are also eliminated in the bile, and undergo enterohepatic circulation. Small intestinal secretion is the main route by which doxycycline is excreted.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">The combination of tetracyclines and penicillins <span style="font-style: italic; ">in vivo</span> produces true antagonism. Despite this, parenteral procaine penicillin and intrauterine oxytetracycline pessaries are a traditional combination for treatment of post-dystocia uterine infections in cattle. There is clinical evidence that this combination is effective.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines are available in almost any formulation needed for almost all routes of administration. Because of their tendency to chelate cations, care should be exercised when choosing an intravenous fluid for administration by infusion. There are major differences in the non-active formulation ingredients from manufacturer to manufacturer. Products which use propylene glycol or ethanolamine as a vehicle tend to be irritant and cause severe muscle damage. Polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) is better - much less irritant, more reliable bioavailability, less carcass damage but more expensive.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Tetracyclines gradually break down while stored, particularly in sunlight, and out of date preparations should not be used (see toxicity).</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Oxytetracycline is used as a cheap, broad spectrum antibiotic, particularly in food animals. It is useful for mycoplasmal diseases such as enzootic pneumonia in pigs.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Doxyclycline is occasionally used for chlamydial or protozoal infections in dogs and cats.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">Human use</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Doxycycline is the only tetracycline used to any great extent, mainly for mixed infections where <span style="font-style: italic; ">Mycoplasma</span>, <span style="font-style: italic; ">Chlamydia </span>or certain protozoa<span style="font-style: italic; "> </span>are likely.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Demeclocycline is sometimes used to suppress anti-diuretic hormone secretion, as well as for its antibacterial effects.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"></p>
			<p class="ParSubhead2">The future?</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Glycylcyclines - tetracycline analogues - are under investigation. They have better activity, particularly against a wide range of resistant organisms. However, some <span style="font-style: italic; ">Salmonella </span>isolates from animals are already showing resistance.</p>
