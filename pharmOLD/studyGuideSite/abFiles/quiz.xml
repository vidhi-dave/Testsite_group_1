  <QUESTION TEXT="1. Benzylpenicillin"
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Benzylpenicillin is rapidly inactivated in the stomach so is usually injected. However, It is quickly excreted by the kidney by a specific carrier which can be blocked using probenecid. Although it does not cross the normal blood brain barrier, if there is inflammation of the meninges it will cross, and is often used clinically for this reason.">
  	<CHOICE>is effective when given orally</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is metabolised rapidly in the neonate</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is usually injected iv</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>excretion may be reduced by probenecid</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>crosses the blood brain barrier easily</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="2. Contra-indications for tetracyclines include"
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Tetracyclines bind to calcium and if given in late pregnancy or when the permanent teeth are growing will stain them yellow and may interfere with their growth. Neonates already have their milk teeth and are not yet growing their permanent teeth. Tetracyclines can cause fatal overgrowth of some gut bacteria in some species but not pigs.">
    <CHOICE>neonatal animals</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>pregnancy</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>pigs</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>anaemia</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>Mycoplasma infection</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="3. Enrofloxacin" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="All the quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase, also known as topoisomerase II. Enrofloxacin is a prodrug for ciprofloxacin. Enrofloxacin is less effective at high doses. The reason for reduced activity at high doses is not clear, but may be because high doses stop protein transcription which is necessary for the drug to act. EnrofloxacinÕs main use is to kill coliforms, which are normally very susceptible. It is usually ineffective against anaerobes and streps; some staphs and Pseudomonas quickly acquire resistance, but Bacillus spp. are usually susceptible.">
  	<CHOICE>inhibits integrase 1</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is a prodrug for carbapenem</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is bacteriostatic at low doses but bactericidal at high doses</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is effective against E. coli</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is ineffective against Bacillus spp.</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="4. Chloramphenicol" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Chloramphenicol is effective orally. It is particularly unsafe in neonates. It penetrates everywhere and has a wide range of side effects, including bone marrow depression. The effect on teeth is seen with tetracyclines.">
  	<CHOICE>must be administered parenterally</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>can be safely used in neonates</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>does not penetrate the blood brain barrier</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>can cause depression of bone marrow function</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>can cause discolouration of developing teeth in pups</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>  
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="5. Sulphonamides" 
  	ANSWER="4" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Sulphonamides block bacterial production of folic acid. Tolbutamide is an oral hypoglycaemic derived from sulphonamides, severe hypoglycaemia has occurred when the two are given together. On their own they are bacteriostatic. They are relatively lipid soluble and get into milk easily.">
  	<CHOICE>inhibit the incorporation of PABA into the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>antagonise the action of tolbutamide</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>are excreted more rapidly in acid urine</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>are secreted into milk</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>are bactericidal</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION> 
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="6. Streptomycin" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Streptomycin is particularly toxic to the sensory cells in the semicircular canals but can also cause deafness, not blindness. It interferes with acetylcholine release to potentiate neuromuscular blockade, although this is rarely clinically important. Streps are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides. It is nephrotoxic rather than cardiotoxic. There are no specific indications for it in cats but it is often given to them!">
  	<CHOICE>may cause blindness</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>may potentiate neuromuscular blockade</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is used to treat strangles</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>is cardiotoxic</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>should not be given to cats</CHOICE>
  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="7. Penicillins are generally useful against" 
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="You will have to learn this sort of information. Bear in mind that it keeps changing as bacteria become resistant!">

    <CHOICE>Escherichia coli</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</CHOICE>

  </QUESTION>
  
  <QUESTION TEXT="8. Chlortetracycline" 
  	ANSWER="1" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Although chlortetracycline could be useful in gerbils, they do not drink so it has to be administered by another route. It binds to calcium so should not be given with milk. The withholding time is 7 - 10 days after oral administration to pigs, depending on the formulation.">
  	<CHOICE>inhibits both Gram positive and negative bacteria</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>may be given to gerbils in their drinking water</CHOICE>
	<CHOICE>is bactericidal</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>should be given with milk in young animals</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>has a zero withholding time in pigs</CHOICE>

  <QUESTION TEXT="9. You are presented with a one year old female Labrador which is staining frequently to pass urine and showing obvious signs of discomfort. The dog has been treated at the practice since birth and has never had any health problems. The best treatment is:" 
  	ANSWER="2" 
  	DefaultFeedback="E. coli is the commonest causative organism of cystitis in bitches, with Staphs, Streps and a variety of Gram - organisms less commonly involved. Co-amoxyclav is likely to be effective in almost all uncomplicated cases, and a culture is not required. Enrofloxacin is also likely to be effective, but should be reserved for cases where nothing else is likely to work, to reduce the development of resistance. Doing nothing is not an option, as the animal's welfare would be compromised. Cranberry juice may have some effect in women, but not grapefruit juice.">
  	<CHOICE>grapefruit juice</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>seven day course of co-amoxyclav</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>take a cystocentesis sample for culture and sensitivity, and treat appropriately when the results come back</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>do nothing, as cystitis is usually self limiting in bitches</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>a single large dose of enrofloxacin</CHOICE>

  <QUESTION TEXT="10. You are presented with a three year old male cat which was involved in a fight several days ago and now has a soft, fluctuant swelling at the base of its tail which you suspect is an abscess. Its temperature is 38.5ûC The best treatment is:"
  ANSWER="5" 
  	DefaultFeedback="Where there is pus, it must be let out. Antibiotics alone will not work. Since lancing the abscess is likely to be painful, an anaesthetic or analgesic should be used.">
  	<CHOICE>a five day course of co-amoxyclav</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>leave it alone as the abscess will eventually burst and drain</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>get a nurse to hold the cat and lance the abscess</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>lance the abscess under ketamine anaesthesia</CHOICE>
    <CHOICE>lance the abscess under ketamine anaesthesia and give a single injection of procaine penicillin</CHOICE>
