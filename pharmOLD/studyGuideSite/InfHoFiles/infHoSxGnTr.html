		<p class="footerSG"><a id="FSH" name="FSH"></a>Follicle Stimulating Hormone</p>
		<p>Natural source is the anterior pituitary gland.<br>
			<br>
			Currently made by extracting hormone from anterior pituitary glands mostly from sheep or pigs (oFSH = ovine, pFSH = porcine). All products are contaminated to some extent with other hormones such as LH. Newer techniques have resulted in greater purity. LH contamination is generally considered to be undesirable since it makes the response of the ovary more unpredictable. Synthetic FSH products are being developed. Biological half life is about 6 hours and therefore twice daily injections required to achieve results.</p>
		<p>Therapeutic uses</p>
		<p>stimulation of follicle growth and development for oestrus induction and superovulation.</p>
		<p>Adverse effects</p>
		<p>excessive stimulation of follicle production resulting in ovarian cysts, endometrial hyperplasia, hyper-oestrogenism.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="LH" name="LH"></a>Luteinising hormone</p>
		<p>Natural source is the anterior pituitary gland. LH products are also made from pituitary extracts and are generally available only for research purposes. Other products are used commercially for their LH like actions (hCG and GnRH).</p>
		<p>Therapeutic uses</p>
		<p>Induction of ovulation</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="eCG" name="eCG"></a>Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG)</p>
		<p>Formerly known as Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) and still marketed under this name in some regions. The natural source is endometrial cups in pregnant mares between days 40-120 of pregnancy. Produced commercially by extracting eCG from serum of pregnant mares or ponies.</p>
		<p>Therapeutic uses</p>
		<p>In the mare, eCG has a primarily LH like action. It binds to LH receptors and results in resurgence of the primary CL of pregnancy and formation of secondary CLs. It has no application in equine reproduction because such massive doses appear to be required to have any effect at all in mares. In other species, eCH binds to both LH and FSH receptors and has a long half life and therefore has become useful in stimulating the development of follicles and ovulation. It is widely used in domestic species other than the mare (sheep, cow, pig) to stimulate development of multiple follicles (superovulation) and to induce oestrus and ovulation in non-cycling animals (pigs).<br>
			<br>
			Long half life (72 hours) and therefore used as a single injection.</p>
		<p>Adverse effects</p>
		<p>eCG has a long duration of action and therefore even a single dose can result in excessive stimulation of ovarian follicular development, resulting in cystic follicles, poor superovulatory response, hyperoestrogenism. Recently researchers have developed an anti-eCG antibody and have administered it 2 days after eCG to stop the adverse effects associated with its prolonged activity. This appears to make the product more effective as a superovulatory drug for domestic species.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="hCG" name="hCG"></a>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)</p>
		<p>Comes from human early blastocyst and placenta - appears in early pregnancy. Commercial product made from the urine of pregnant women.</p>
		<p>Actions</p>
		<p>LH like effect primarily and involved in women in CL support and pregnancy maintenance. In other species it is used for its LH effect primarily, for example ovulation induction, challenge testing, treatment of cryptorchidism.<br>
			<br>
			hCG is a relatively large molecule and is capable of inducing an antigenic response in animals since it represents foreign protein.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="GnRH" name="GnRH"></a>Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)</p>
		<p>Comes from the hypothalamus. GnRH is a very small molecule (decapeptide) which is easily synthesized and numerous synthetic formulations are available. There is no risk of antibody stimulation and therefore very safe to use. It appears to be replacing hCG in most applications for these reasons.</p>
		<p>Actions</p>
		<p>Stimulation of LH and FSH release and therefore stimulation of ovarian and testicular activity.<br>
			induction of cyclicity and ovulation (cystic ovaries in cows, ovulation in all species)<br>
			increased spermatogenesis ?<br>
			increased libido?<br>
			challenge or diagnostic testing.<br>
			<br>
			Injectable products have been available for years. Recently a biodegradable implant was released for use in horses to cause ovulation.</p>
