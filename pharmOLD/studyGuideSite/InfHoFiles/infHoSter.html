		<p>Glucocorticoids bind to their receptors in the cytoplasm and the receptor - drug complex is then translocated into the nucleus where it interferes with transcriptional regulation to stimulate or inhibit the transcription of mRNA. Variable responses by different cells to steroid therapy may be explained by variable penetration of cells and tissue types, different receptors, variable access to specific DNA sequences in different cells or other variations in intracellular environments.</p>

		<p class="footerSG"><a id="antiInfEff" name="antiInfEff"></a>Anti-inflammatory actions</p>
		<p>Glucocorticosteroids exert their anti-inflammatory effects on cells by stimulating or inhibiting the production and effects of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>lipocortin<br>
				Lipocortin inhibits phospholipase A2 which mediates release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipids of cell membranes.
			<li>LDL receptors<br>
				Low density lipoproteins are thought to be a major source of arachidonic acid after the initial release of arachidonic acid from the cell membranes. Glucocorticosteroids inhibit the synthesis and the expression of LDL receptors necessary for transport of LDL into the cell.
			<li>COX 2 (inducible cyclo-oxygenase)<br>
				Concentrations of COX 2 within inflammatory cells increase dramatically in response to stimuli. The synthesis of COX 2 is directly inhibited by the presence of glucocorticoids. Concentrations of COX 1 are less affected at anti-inflammatory doses.
			<li>Cytokines<br>
				The production and or effects of some cytokines are inhibited by the presence of therapeutic concentrations of the glucocorticoids:<br>
				tumour necrosis factor (TNF)<br>
				interleukin 1 (IL 1 )<br>
				platelet activating factor (PAF)<br>
				a variety of 'growth factors'
			<li>Lysosomal membrane stabilization<br>
				Stabilization of lysosomal membranes has long been reported as the predominant anti inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids. The extent to which this happens, if at all, and its significance is not really known.
		</ul>
		<p>The anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticosteroids at a cellular level are due to<br>
			&#x2022;inhibition of recruitment of leukocytes<br>
			&#x2022;inhibition of elaborating of inflammatory mediators by damaged and recruited cells<br>
			&#x2022;interference in the synthesis and activation of catabolic enzymes<br>
			&#x2022;suppression of the generation of granulation tissue.</p>
		<p>The use of glucocorticosteroids is generally thought to inhibit primary wound healing. Their controlled use, however, can reduce scar formation and reduce the generation of excessive granulation tissue.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="immSuppEff" name="immSuppEff"></a>Immunosuppressive effects</p>
		<p>The different types of leukocytes have differing sensitivities to glucocorticosteroid concentrations and their effects are manifested in different ways. The systemic glucocorticosteroid concentrations required to induce a generalized immunosuppression are much larger than anti-inflammatory concentrations. However, a degree of immunosuppression always follows any systemic glucocorticosteroid therapy. In general one can administer a large single dose of a short to medium acting glucocorticosteroid without any serious adverse affect. However, prolonged systemic therapy can be associated with a number of potentially serious affects. (See immunosuppressant notes below)</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="hpa" name="hpa"></a>Hypothalamic - Pituitary - Adrenal axis</p>
		<p>(<a href="infHoSterCushD.html">diagram</a>)<br>
			Endogenous adrenal cortisol production is controlled through the effects of the pituitary produced hormone ACTH. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone) (AVP, or ADH), produced in the hypothalamus, are responsible for stimulating the production and release of ACTH from the pituitary. The secretion of CRF from the hypothalamus generally follows a diurnal pattern in man and some animal species, peaking in the morning and being lowest in the evening. This is not the case for our domestic species. A pulsatile increased secretion of CRF is in response to stimuli which signal increased glucocorticoid need such as exercise, trauma, and cold. High plasma cortisol concentrations act as negative feedback, reducing further synthesis and release of AVP and CRF from the hypothalamus, and ACTH from the pituitary and inhibit further production. The presence of significant concentrations of exogenous glucocorticosteroids will also inhibit the synthesis and release of AVP, CRF, and ACTH and as a consequence markedly suppress endogenous plasma cortisol concentrations. <br>
			<br>
			Extended exposure to significant systemic concentrations of exogenous glucocorticosteroids can result in adrenal cortical atrophy. Persistently elevated concentrations may result in a period when the adrenal cortex is non - responsive, or has a diminished response to either stress induced ACTH release, or even exogenous ACTH administration. </p>

		<p class="footerSG"><a id="drugs" name="drugs"></a>Drugs</p>
		<p>The glucocorticoid bases in common use are listed in approximately ascending order of potency. This order also corresponds to increasing length of action of the base.<br>
			<br>
			Short acting<br>
			hydrocortisone<br>
			prednisolone<br>
			prednisone</p>
		<p>Medium Acting<br>
				methylprednisolone<br>
			triamcinolone</p>
		<p>Long acting<br>
			betamethasone <br>
				dexamethasone.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="pharmaceut" name="pharmaceut"></a>Pharmaceutical considerations</p>
		<p>The glucocorticoid bases are prepared as salts or esters. The pharmacokinetics of the drug product can be markedly affected by the compounding. Glucocorticoid - base - salt(ester) compounds are prepared in different excipient formulations. The formulation can also markedly affect the pharmacokinetics of the product. Therefore, the potency and duration of effect of a glucocorticosteroid are determined by:<br>
			The base<br>
			The base compound<br>
			The formulation<br>
			<br>
			Examples of base-compounds: hydrocortisone sodium succinate, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and dexamethasone sodium phosphate. <br>
			<br>
			Most glucocorticosteroid bases can be classed as alcohols which are relatively insoluble in water. The sodium salt of the phosphate or succinate ester is generally used to provide water soluble forms for intravenous or intramuscular injection. Acetate and isonicotinate esters are relatively insoluble. They are usually prepared as aqueous suspensions for subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. Because they are insoluble they are absorbed slowly. These are the depot formulations. Acetonides and diproprionates tend to be the least soluble of this group. Fluorination or esterification with fatty acids or cyclic acetonides increases topical anti-inflammatory activity often without increasing systemic glucocorticoid activity.<br>
			<br>
			Formulations<br>
			Tablets, aqueous solutions, aqueous suspensions, alcohol solutions, creams, and ointments are available. Formulation characteristics dictate the possible routes of administration and the absorption characteristics from these sites. Variations in particle size, excipient, pH, and physicochemical characteristics can all affect the absorption of the formulation.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="pks" name="pks"></a>Pharmacokinetics</p>
		<p>Available pharmacokinetic information doesn't always correlate with observed duration of clinical effect due to the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticosteroids and because many assays are not sensitive enough to measure pharmacologically significant glucocorticosteroid concentrations e.g. one equine pharmacokinetic report quotes that prednisolone was assayable for 7 days following an intramuscular injection of 200 mg of prednisolone acetate into the gluteal musculature. The same paper reports the endogenous cortisol concentrations were depressed for 21 days following the same injection.<br>
			<br>
			<i>
			Absorption</i><br>
			
			formulation effects<br>
			oral preparations - available predominantly as free bases<br>
			aqueous solutions - most readily and rapidly absorbed <br>
			short acting aqueous suspensions - dissolve quickly into body fluids, are relatively rapidly absorbed, produce peak blood concentrations within a few hours after injection and are totally eliminated from the body within 3 days of administration. <br>
			organic solutions in polyethylene glycol, e.g. azium solutions = dexamethasone alcohol dissolved in polyethylene glycol. (other organic solvents are also used) - some precipitate at the site of injection and are absorbed at a slightly slower rate and hence produce lower peak plasma concentrations which are maintained for slightly longer<br>
			long acting or depot formulations e.g. methylprednisolone acetate - can take from 1 - 4 days to achieve (relatively low) peak plasma concentrations - may take a number of weeks for plasma concentrations to decline to undetectable concentrations - may associated with local tissue damage around the site of injection - major species and individual variations in both the extent and duration of HPA axis suppression - may suppress endogenous plasma cortisol concentrations for only 3 days in the horse but up to 12 weeks in cattle.<br>
			<br>
			Ester/salt effects<br>
			hemisuccinate, succinate and phosphate esters are the most water soluble products available. They are used when rapid glucocorticoid effect is desired, when the intravenous route of administration is chosen, and can also be injected intramuscularly and subcutaneously. They are relatively rapidly absorbed and result in high early plasma concentrations.<br>
			<br>
			Alcohol and isonicotinate in propylene glycol have been used intravenously (in the horse) . Their duration of effects are predominantly determined by the glucocorticoid base when administered intravenously. They form depots when injected intramuscularly.<br>
			<br>
			The acetate, diacetate, trimethylacetate, tebutate and phenylpropionate esters are poorly water soluble; their absorption tends to be slow and sustained. When given by the intra-articular or intra-lesional route, high concentrations will be maintained locally for a long time. When given im, these esters form depots resulting in low plasma concentrations for periods of at least 2 to 14 days, depending on the dose, base, formulation and species injected. <br>
			<br>
			Acetonide esters are used topically and are poorly water soluble. They will bind to keratin potentially lowering their systemic absorption following topical use. <br>
			<br>
			Free bases or the salt of an organic acid form (such as betamethasone benzoate) are also used. <br>
			<br>
			<i>
			Distribution</i><br>
			
			Glucocorticosteroids are widely distributed in the body both intra and extracellularly. They predominantly exert their effects intracellularly. Cortisol is approximately 90% protein bound in plasma. About 75% to the steroid binding globulin transcortin and 10 - 15% to serum albumin. Transcortin has a high affinity, particularly for cortisol or prednisolone, but low capacity, whereas albumin has a low affinity but much higher capacity. <br>
			<br>
			<i>
			Metabolism</i><br>
			
			Most glucocorticosteroid compounds are rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma or synovial fluid to release their active base. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate is not readily hydrolyzable in plasma and along with prednisone and cortisone requires hepatic metabolism to be converted into their active form, and thus are unsuitable for local or topical administrations. <br>
			Biotransformation is complex, but reduction of the double bond between C4 and C5 occurs mainly in the liver. This inactivates the molecule which is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted via the kidneys<br>
			<br>
			<i>
			Elimination</i><br>
			
			Very variable. Most are metabolized first then excreted in the urine - very little faecal or unchanged urinary excretion. Elimination of depot preparations is absorption rate limited.</p>

		<p>Therapy of less than 3 - 5 days rarely causes any serious adverse effects unless other risk factors exist, e.g. diabetes mellitus, fulminant bacterial infection.<br>
			<br>
			Some adverse effects occur routinely even with short duration of therapy:<br>

			&#x2022;abortion (C16 substituted glucocorticosteroids only)<br>
			&#x2022;peptic and gastric ulceration<br>
			<br>
			Some adverse effects occur especially with long term therapy - <a href="infHoSterCush.html">Cushing's syndrome</a></p>

			<br>
				An Addisonian crisis (cardiovascular collapse, respiratory collapse, coma, death) may occur especially with sudden withdrawal of long term therapy due to HPA axis suppression</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="dosing" name="dosing"></a>Dosing strategies</p>
		<p>Serious adverse effects are almost always avoidable. Incorrect or negligent use of these drugs is the most common reason for adverse effects. Adverse effects and toxicity can be largely avoided by use of the correct dose rates and regimens for different indications. In general, an adequate dose should be used by an appropriate route for the required speed of onset, then the dose tapered off to nothing / as low as possible depending on the condition.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>cats and birds are less sensitive and require higher doses than most other species
			<li>if therapy is short duration then tapering of dose rates and regimens is not necessary.
			<li>if therapy lasts for longer than 1 - 2 weeks (prednisolone) or 1 week (dexamethasone) then before therapy is interrupted the dose rate must be gradually tapered to a maintenance dose rate and the dose interval must be lengthened to 48 hours to allow the HPA axis to reawaken.
			<li>only short acting glucocorticoids can be used for alternate day dosing (hydrocortisone (12 hr), cortisone (12 hr), prednis(ol)one (12-36 hr), methylprednisolone (12-36 hr)) - long acting glucocorticoids are not suitable for alternate day dosing (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, betamethasone)
		</ul>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="mineralocort" name="mineralocort"></a>Mineralocorticoid effects</p>
		<p>Mineralocorticoids are used solely in the treatment of adrenal cortical insufficiency (Addison's disease) since most glucocorticosteroids used in replacement therapy have insufficient mineralocorticoid activity to sufficiently control electrolyte excretion. Drugs such as desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) (injectable, specific mineralocorticoid) or fludrocortisone (tablets, more common) are used to produce increased extracellular fluid volume, sodium and fluid retention, potassium and hydrogen ion loss and increased glomerular filtration rate.</p>
