<p class="titleSG">Cushing's syndrome</p>
		<p>(<a href="infHoSterCushD.html">diagram</a>)</p>
		<p>Cushing's syndrome results from too much circulating corticosteroid. There are three main causes:<br>
			&#x2022;iatrogenic - the commonest cause in veterinary practice!!<br>
			&#x2022;excessive production of ACTH from the pituitary<br>
			&#x2022;adrenal tumours or hyperplasia</p>
		<p>Treatment of iatrogenic Cushing's involves tapering off the dose of steroids (see notes above); the other two have traditionally been treated with mitotane in dogs (surgery in man), although several other drugs are starting to be used, particularly selegiline. Cushing's in horses is usually caused by excessive ACTH production and is treated with dopamine agonists such as pergolide.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Drugs</p>
		<p>The most commonly used drug in dogs has been mitotane, but it is an unpleasant drug and safer alternatives are coming into use. Selegiline has been licensed in the USA in the dog and there are a variety of human drugs coming onto the market.<br>
			<br>
			It was discovered in the 1940s that the insecticide DDD (similar to DDT) destroyed the adrenal glands in dogs. The o,p' isomer (mitotane, = o,p' DDD) was found to be responsible. It has a direct cytotoxic effect on the zonae fasiculata and reticularis of the adrenal cortex and probably acts by killing mitochondria. Mitotane also inhibits steroid synthesis.<br>
			<br>
			Mitotane&rsquo;s absorption is poor and variable in dogs. It is best when tablets are crushed up in oily food but this exposes the owner to the drug. Very fat soluble - taken up with fat.<br>
			<br>
			Side effects are a major problem: overdose will cause Addison's disease (low corticosteroids). Some dogs will develop Addison's even at low doses. This often kills dogs. Steroid supplementation may be necessary. Anorexia, vomiting, lethargy and ataxia may also occur.</p>
		<p>Other drugs sometimes (rarely) used in Cushing's syndrome</p>
		<ul>
			<li>drugs which act on the HPA axis, such as selegeline (= l deprenyl) (monoamine oxidase B inhibitor - stops dopamine breakdown (also stops 5HT breakdown - interacts with pethidine to kill dogs)), bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) and cyproheptadine (dirty 5HT antagonist)
			<li>drugs which reduce steroid synthesis, such as metyrapone, aminoglutethimide, trilostane (shown to work in dogs but not available in NZ yet), etomidate, suramin are not often used in animals.
			<li>drugs which block steroid receptors, the only current example is mifepristone. Beware, this will cause abortion in pregnant animals (and women).
		</ul>
		<p>Dexamethasone is sometimes given to diagnose Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome. It should suppress the production of ACTH and steroid in a normal dog but interpretation of abnormal results can be tricky.</p>
