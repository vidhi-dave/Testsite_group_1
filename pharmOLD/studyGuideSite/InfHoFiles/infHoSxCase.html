		<p class="footerSG"><a id="breedingB" name="breedingB"></a>Progesterone assays for timing of breeding in the bitch <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>Average bitch has pro-oestrus lasting 7-9 days and oestrus lasting 7-9 days and ovulates on about the 3rd or 4th day of standing oestrus. A traditional recommendation from breeders is to breed an oestral bitch on the 13th day after the beginning of pro-oestrus. <br>
			However, there is tremendous variation in both the length of pro-oestrus and oestrus and the timing of ovulation in bitches of normal fertility. Behaviour and vaginal cytology are not very accurate at determining when a bitch will ovulate. The bitch appears to be unique amongst domestic animals in that peripheral blood progesterone concentration rises prior to ovulation. It can therefore be measured and used as a predictor of impending ovulation. In all other species of domestic animals, progesterone does not rise until after ovulation.<br>
			In addition, the bitch ovulates a primary oocyte which takes about 2 days after ovulation to mature and become ready for fertilization (different to other species as well).<br>
			<br>
			Event			Progesterone concentration<br>
			pro-oestrus &amp; early oestrus	very low (&lt;3nmol/l)<br>
			time of LH surge	6-9 nmol/l (2-3 ng/ml)<br>
			day of ovulation	12-25 nmol/l (4-8 ng/ml)<br>
			optimal time of breeding	28-80 nmol/l (9-25 ng/ml)<br>
			<br>
			The optimal time to breed a normal bitch is about 2 days after ovulation.<br>
			A suggested protocol is take a blood sample at about the 3rd to 4th day of pro-oestrus and measure progesterone concentration. If very low, take a second sample 2-4 days later. Continue sampling until an increase is seen. Then:<br>
			If you have identified a change from &lt;3 to 6-9 nmol/l, consider breeding the bitch 1-2 days later and again 1-2 days after the first breeding. Consider measuring progesterone at the time of the second breeding to document the rise, confirm ovulation and determine whether further testing is necessary.<br>
			May wish to continue taking daily samples until you reach about 25 nmol/l and then breed the bitch. This approach is more commonly followed if using frozen semen.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="ORS" name="ORS"></a>Diagnosis of ovarian remnant syndrome in the bitch <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>ORS describes the bitch who has a history of being speyed and who now is showing signs consistent with oestrus. Signs include vulval swelling, serosanguineous vulval discharge, attraction to males, mammary gland development. Signs are suggestive of oestrogenism.<br>
			Primary differentials for oestrogenism are oestrogen secreting neoplasia, adrenal gland activity and a remaining remnant of ovarian tissue. Other differentials should be included for vulval discharge: urinary tract disease, vaginitis, uterine stump infection etc).<br>
			Diagnostic workup: complete physical, vaginal cytology, urinalysis, vaginoscopy, abdominal ultrasound/radiography.<br>
			Challenge testing: take a pretreatment blood sample for oestradiol and progesterone concentration. Admininster hCG (100-500 iu by im or iv injection) or GnRH (25-100 ug). 2-3 weeks later, repeat physical examination and blood testing. Look for changes consistent with ovulation and formation of luteal tissue. If changes are consistent with the presence of ovarian tissue, schedule surgery. If not continue diagnostics eg adrenal gland suppression testing.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="cryptorchH" name="cryptorchH"></a>Diagnosis of cryptorchidism in horses <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>Animals with a history of castration but which are now showing signs of male behaviour. A cryptorchid testicle can be retained within the abdomen or just outside the abdomen in the inguinal region. A detailed physical examination including palpation/ultrasound of the inguinal and scrotal regions and transrectal palpation/ultrasound should be performed.<br>
			Challenge testing should be considered for equivocal cases. Take a baseline blood sample and then administer hCG (2500 to 5000 iu iv). Take follow up blood samples. There is considerable debate about the best time to take follow up samples. Some labs suggest a second sample 2 hours after the injection. I prefer to wait longer and take follow up samples at 6-12 hours and occasionally at 24 hours. Look for a 2-fold increase in testosterone concentration. If this does occur it is highly likely there is testicular tissue present.<br>
			it is also possible to measure oestrone sulphate concentration in blood. In animals older than 3 years of age, oestrone sulphate concentration in a single sample (no challenge) is often sufficient to diagnose a cryptorchid (levels are low in geldings and very high in cryptorchids and stallions).<br>
			Challenge testing for cryptorchidism may also be performed in dogs and other species.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="pyoB" name="pyoB"></a>Medical treatment for pyometra in the bitch <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>Case selection: younger than 6 years of age, with a primary breeding function.<br>
			Stabilise systemic signs of illness associated with the disease eg fluid therapy<br>
			Once stable begin prostaglandin F2a treatment: older recommendations used high doses: 250&micro;g/kg sc twice daily, more recently, lower doses are suggested, down to as low as 20&micro;g/kg sc three times daily<br>
			It is best to begin at a reasonably low dose(100-150&micro;g/kg sc twice daily) and work up to a dose of 250&micro;g/kg sc twice daily.<br>
			Beware: side effects do occur, success rate is not 100%, pyometra tends to recur and treatment is expensive.<br>
			Duration of treatment is variable and depends on response. Older recommendations suggested 5-8 days of prostaglandin therapy. Newer approaches suggest that the bitch be monitored by ultrasound and treatment continued until at least 1 day after the uterus is observed to be free of luminal fluid on ultrasound (can take 10-14 days).<br>
			Breed on the next heat period. Consider treating the bitch with systemic antibiotic during oestrus and spey the animal as soon as her breeding function is finished (as soon as the desired number of pups are achieved).</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="misallB" name="misallB"></a>Misalliance in the bitch <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>Oestradiol benzoate is now the only licensed oestrogen for mismating. However, oestrogens have potentially serious side effects in the bitch:<br>
			i) bone marrow suppression: life threatening aplastic anaemia. Very difficult to treat successfully. Fortunately this is a rare side effect unless large doses or very long acting analogues are used.<br>
			ii) cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH): CEH appears to be a common side effect of oestrogen therapy and is often followed by pyometra. Oestrogens potentiate the effect of progesterone on the uterus and together the two hormones increase the risk of CEH. The presence of CEH, progesterone dominance (luteal phase of the cycle) and contaminating bacteria is highly likely to result in pyometra.<br>
			The risk of pyometra appears to be highest when oestrogens are administered to a bitch in early dioestrus (high progesterone).<br>
			It is ironic that owners who present bitches for misalliance injections often acknowledge that the bitch has a valuable breeding future. They then request oestrogen treatment which at very best might have no effect on future breeding potential but which is more likely to reduce the animal's future breeding potential.<br>
			No dose of oestrogen has been shown to be both effective and safe.<br>
			Suggested protocol when presented with a bitch with a history of misalliance:<br>
			Physical examination: is the bitch in oestrus?<br>
			Vaginal cytology: is she in oestrus, can you see sperm?<br>
			<br>
			Options:<br>
				1) do nothing and let the bitch whelp if she is in fact pregnant<br>
				2) ovariohysterectomy<br>
				3) do nothing initially and pregnancy test the animal at about 25-30 days and consider aborting the bitch using PGF2a injections &plusmn; dopamine agonists at this stage (preferred option). Mifepristone would be better but is not available in NZ.<br>
				4) Oestrogen as a last resort. Counsel the owner that treatment will make the bitch receptive to males for a further period of time (7-10 days), it is not 100% successful and may have serious side effects.<br>
			<br>
			Treatment regimes:<br>
			0.3 mg/kg up to maximum of 10 mg, as a single im or sc injection, given 1-4 days after mating. Should only be administered if the bitch is still in oestrus as determined by vaginal cytology.<br>
			10&micro;g/kg on days 3, 5 and 7 after mating. Does use a lower dose and is reported to be less likely to prolong behavioural receptivity or lead to bone marrow suppression but is more likely to result in elevated oestrogen concentrations in early dioestrus.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="prevOesB" name="prevOesB"></a>Inhibition and prevention of signs of oestrus in the bitch <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>In NZ, progestagens are the primary drug used for controlling the oestrous cycle of the bitch. An alternative drug which appears to be safer (mibolerone - an androgen) is available overseas.<br>
			suppression: means treatment initiated in early pro-oestrus to inhibit signs of behavioural receptivity. Generally requires higher levels of progestagen and is also associated with higher risk of side effects since it means using higher levels of progestagen on top of elevated levels of oestrogen.<br>
			postponement: means beginning treatment in late anoestrus to postpone the next pro-oestrus. This is considered to be safer, since it avoids any association with elevated oestrogen and usually allows the use of lower doses of progestagen.<br>
			General cautions for progestagens in bitches:<br>
			Use with caution in animals with a primary breeding future<br>
			Read the manufacturer's recommendations, particularly contra-indications<br>
			Advise the owner of possible side effects.<br>
			Abide by the manufacturer's recommendations for treatment protocols.<br>
			In decreasing order of safety, the progestagens available in NZ for oestrous control are: proligestone, megestrol, medroxyprogesterone (MPA)<br>
			Medroxyprogesterone acetate was withdrawn from the small animal market for oestrous control in the USA by a voluntary deal from the manufacturer in 1966 due to the high incidence of uterine abnormalities in treated bitches. In an Australian study (AVJ 70:249-250, 1993) 45% of treated bitches were found to have uterine lesions at subsequent spay compared to 0.05% of control bitches. As a result it is suggested that you avoid using MPA for oestrous control in bitches where ever possible since safer alternatives are available.<br>
			Greyhounds are a special case. Progestagens are associated with side effects which are undesirable for performance animals: weight gain, lethargy, reduced athletic ability. Most greyhound owners and trainers prefer to have racing bitches on some form of oestrus suppression but they usually use anabolic steroids .</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="syncprogC" name="syncprogC"></a>Oestrus synchronizationin heifers using progestagens <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>Usually combined with other drugs such as oestrogens, PGF2alpha and PMSG (eCG).<br>
			There are currently two main products available in NZ for delivering progestagens to cattle. One is the CIDR-B (vaginal implant impregnated with progesterone) and the other is an ear implant impregnated with a synthetic analogue (Crestar implants which contain norgestomet).<br>
			There are many different treatment programmes with the variations mostly in how long the devices are left in place (ie, duration of progestagen therapy) and when to administer other drugs. Continued advances are being made each year in the design of these programmes. Therefore it is best to contact prodct manufacturers for the latest regime when you are in practice. Recommendations will vary depending on the type of cattle you are treating eg heifers versus cows, beef cattle versus dairy.<br>
			i) Early recommendations were to treat with progestagen only for a length of time equal to the normal CL lifespan (15-17 days). This ensured adequate time for any endogenous CLs to have regressed during treatment. Synchronization of oestrus was quite good but fertility was poor and it was subsequently found that longer durations of progestagen therapy reduced fertility.<br>
			ii) Next step was to shorten the duration of progestagen treatment and add PGF2a treatments to lyse any CLs which were present. Regimes came down to about 7-10 days of progestagen with PGF added close to the end of the progestagen treatment. Oestrogens were also administered at the beginning of treatment and helped to lyse CLs as well as having a synergistic effect with progesterone inhibiting gonadotropin release and follicle development during treatment, which helps to produce better synchrony when treatment ends.<br>
			iii) The latest development has been the addition of a low dose of oestradiol given 1-2 days after cessation of progestagen treatment. This helps to stimulate overt displays of oestrus behaviour for oestrus detection and also helps to trigger the LH surge to induce ovulation.<br>
			Examples of two standard programmes for heifers:<br>
			Ensure all animals are in fact cycling prior to treatment.<br>
			1. Insert ear implant norgestromet (Crestar)<br>
			Inject with oestrogen at the time of insertion<br>
			Inject with PGF2a on day 7-8<br>
			Remove ear implant on day 9-10<br>
			Inject with PMSG at time of implant removal	.<br>
			Breed heifers based on oestrus detection or by timed breeding (48 hours after implant removal).<br>
			2. Insert CIDR-B and CIDIROL capsule (capsule contains oestrogen and fits into a slot in the CIDR-B) into the vagina.<br>
			Remove CIDR-B on day 7.<br>
			Inject with PGF2a at time of CIDR removal.<br>
			Inject with oestradiol benzoate (1 mg) 24-48 hours after implant removal.<br>
			Breed based on oestrus detection.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="syncPGC" name="syncPGC"></a>Oestrus synchronization in heifers using prostaglandin F2? <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a></span></p>
		<p>The bovine corpus luteum is not susceptible to exogenous PGF until five days or more after ovulation. You should ensure all animals are cycling prior to beginning the programme. Generally do this by tail painting animals and watching for activity.<br>
			Again there are several different programmes:<br>
			1. Treat all animals with a single injection of PGF. Inseminate based on oestrus detection. Animals which respond will come into oestrus about 2-3 days later.<br>
			2. Palpate heifers and only administer PGF to those heifers which have a palpable CL on rectal palpation. Inseminate based on oestrus detection.<br>
			3. For the first 6 days of the programme, perform daily oestrus detection and breed animals based on oestrus detection. Then on day 6, inject all animals which have not been bred with PGF and continue oestrus detection and breeding.<br>
			4. Administer 2 injections of PGF separated by 11 days. At the time of the second injection, almost all animals should be responsive to PGF. May inseminate on oestrus detection or by timed insemination (heifers bred about 60-70 hours after second injection).</p>
