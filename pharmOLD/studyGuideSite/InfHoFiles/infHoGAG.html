<p class="titleSG">Glycosaminoglycans</p>
		<p>A variety of high molecular weight, long chain mucopolysaccharides which mimic normal components of cartilage are used to treat arthritis in dogs and horses. Most of these are polysulphated glycosaminoglycans. They include various chondroitin sulphates (eg &quot;Adequan&quot;, not available in NZ), pentosan polysulphate (not strictly a polysulphated glycosaminoglycan but very similar- it is a semisynthetic pentasaccharide derived from beech wood shavings and present in many grains) and hyaluronic acid (a normal constituent of synovial fluid and cartilage matrix). Heparin is very similar, and most of the synthetic drugs started life as heparin - type anticoagulants in the 1950s.</p>
		<p>All these drugs have a wide range of effects and it is not clear at the moment which effects are most important. The effects also appear to be dose related. All work best in mild, early joint disease without destructive changes, although good clinical trials of these drugs are lacking.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Mechanism of action</p>
		<p>Limit cartilage degradation by inhibiting enzymes causing proteoglycan degradation<br>
			Support cartilage matrix synthesis by increasing proteoglycans synthesis<br>
			Improve the quality of synovial fluid by stimulating the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and has an anti-prostaglandin effect<br>
			Improve circulation to the tissues of the joint because of anticoagulant activity <br>
			Inhibit fibroblast growth factor and other cytokines. Fibroblast growth factor is required for neovascularisation and for growth of some types of tumour; pentosan is undergoing clinical trials as an anticancer drug in people at the moment.<br>
			Hyaluronic acid may also increase the viscoelasticity of synovial fluid.<br>
			Probably indirectly affect many aspects of proteoglycan turnover via cytokines</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Indications</p>
		<p>adjunct therapy to correct the cause of osteoarthritis (cruciate or intra articular fracture)<br>
			chronic osteoarthritis<br>
			primary osteoarthritis <br>
			degenerative joint disease<br>
			<br>
			Duration of soundness after treatment increases with the molecular weight of the product from about 50 days to about 160 days.<br>
			They are usually given intra-articularly, although they may work after im injection too. They are broken down in the gut, so are not much use orally (see below).</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Contraindications</p>
		<p>&#x2022;infection<br>
			&#x2022;animals with clotting defects or traumatic haemorrhage<br>
			&#x2022;liver or kidney disease</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Side effects</p>
		<p>Local reaction post-injection when given intra-articularly<br>
			<br>
			Extreme care must be taken to avoid introducing infection when making repeated intra-articular injections.<br>
			<br>
			Heparin like clotting problems and immune mediated hypersensitivity have occurred in people.<br>
			<br>
			These drugs are not cheap.</p>

		<p>Glucosamine is the basic building block of GAGs. It is normally made from glucose by chondrocytes, but is preferentially taken up if available, and stimulates the production of GAGs (glucosamine availability is the rate limiting step).<br>
			Glucosamine is completely bioavailable from the gut and is practially non toxic, so is sometimes included in horse food.<br>
			It has a wide range of useful effects in vitro, and appears to have a small beneficial effect in osteoarthritis in rats and people. It modifies the progress of the disease rather than providing analgesia, so it takes several months for improvements to be seen in people. There are no clinical trials in dogs or horses, but as it probably has a beneficial effect and is unlikely to cause harm, it is becoming more widely used.<br>
			Glucosamine is currently being investigated for vCJD in people.</p>
