<p class="titleSG">Residues - withholding times</p>
<p>Once the MRL for the active ingredient has been established (and officially
  approved), drug companies carry out pharmacokinetic tests with their product
  to see how long it takes for tissue levels to decline to the MRL. Another fudge
  factor is added on to allow for individual variation (and sometimes for the
  effects of disease) and that time becomes the withholding time. Since the pharmacokinetics
  of a drug will be different in different species, this process must be repeated
  for each species. This is expensive. nb, the withholding time calculated by
  a drug company is only valid for their formulation of the drug, a product containing
  the same active ingredient from a different company may require a different
withholding time.</p>
<p>If you use the drug according to the instructions on the bottle
  and stick to the withholding time given, the chances of a residue above the
  MRL are very
  small (although not zero). If you vary the dose or route of administration,
  or give the drug to an animal for which it is not licensed, then you have to
  work out a new withholding period. There are several options. If you have the
  full pharmacokinetic data and are into stats / suffer from masochistic tendencies
  you can use the same procedure as the drug companies
  (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/cvm/fda/TOCs/guideline3pt6.html ">outlined by
the FDA).</a> It involves calculating the 95% confidence interval below which
99% of animals will fall, and <a href="PKsWHTcalc.html">working out when this
crosses the MRL</a>.</p>
<p>If you have data on the half life of the drug in milk or meat, and you double
the dose, you can establish a new withholding time by adding on a half life.</p>
<p>If
  the trade name product is licensed overseas (EU or USA) for the use you intend,
  then you could use the overseas withholding periods. Beware - the MRLs may
  not be
  the
  same. You must also compare like with like - eg penicillin injections from
  different companies may have different formulations which affect their pharmacokinetics
  and thus withholding times. (Information for <a href="http://www.farad.org/">products
  in the USA</a>.)  Europe does not yet have much useful information
  on line, but the British data is published by NOAH in two annual publications: &#8220;Withdrawal
  Periods for Veterinary Products&#8221; and &#8220;Compendium of data sheets
for veterinary products&#8221;. It is also contained in the Veterinary Formulary.</p>
<p>You
  can use a &#8220;standard&#8221; withholding time. This is a (long) time
  calculated to avoid residues for most drugs. A figure of 63 days has been suggested
  for NZ, in the UK the figures are 28 days for meat, 7 days for milk and eggs
and 500&#176; days for fish.</p>
<p>It is always wise to err on the side of caution, but
bear in mind this will probably involve increased costs for the farmer.</p>
<p>The
  bottom line is that unless you know what you are doing, or there is absolutely
  no chance of the animal getting into the food chain, it is better to stick
  to the instructions on the bottle.<br>
  Problems arise with horses, which are classified as food animals (even in NZ)
  because of the barbaric eating habits of the French. It is illegal not to give
  an animal's owner information which will prevent residues in the meat, even
  though
  the average girl with a sick pony is unlikely to take kindly to being told
  not to eat her pet for the next four weeks. One way around the problem is to
  write &quot;this horse must not be sold for human consumption for x weeks&quot; in
very small print at the bottom of the invoice.</p>
