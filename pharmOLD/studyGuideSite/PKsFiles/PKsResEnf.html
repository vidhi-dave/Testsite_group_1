<p class="footerSG">How are excess residues prevented?</p>
<p>&#8226;
  Focus your farmers on the importance of withholding times<br>
&#8226;
  Follow label instructions closely<br>
&#8226;
  If you deviate at all then increase the withholding time<br>
&#8226;
  Make sure treated animals are readily identifiable<br>
&#8226;
Leave a written record of all treatments and the withholding time</p>
<p class="footerSG">National Residue
Monitoring and Surveillance (NRMS) programme</p>
<p>MAF is responsible for running
  New Zealand's National Residue Monitoring and Surveillance programme (NRMS)
  for meat and offal, and undertakes most of the
  enforcement activities. The analytical testing alone costs in the region of
  2 million dollars a year with 117 chemicals specifically looked for, and approximately
  70,000 analyses completed.<br>
The NRMS programme consists of three different parts.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. The random monitoring
      programme is designed to provide domestic and international assurances as
    to the overall effectiveness of New Zealand's residue controls
      in preventing consumers from being exposed to toxicologically significant
    amounts of residues. All animals sampled are randomly selected and this progrannne
      is essentially an audit of the effectiveness of the control measures the
    country
      has in place to prevent residues in excess of defined limits finding their
      way into the human food chain.<br>
    2. The surveillance targeted sampling programme targets suppliers and animals
      which for some reason have been identified as posing more of a risk. Previously
      identified non-complying farmers, sheep smelling of dip, and cattle with
      mastitic udders or injection site lesions are examples of reasons why certain
      animals
      or lines will be specifically targeted for more intensive sampling and analytical
      testing.<br>
    3. Surveys aimed at identifying potential problems are a way the MAF and
      the industry can be more proactive, and allow for early identification of
      possible
      future problems so that effective control measures can be implemented in
      advance. They also provide valuable data on which the Ministry can base a
      case against
    overseas markets trying to impose more testing on us.</p>

  Condemnations<br>
&#8226; 
  Suspect listing<br>
&#8226; 
  Increased costs<br>
&#8226; 
  Black listing by processors<br>
&#8226; 
  Possible prosecution<br>
  If the NRMS programme detects residues above MRLs in any samples analysed then;
  firstly, a trace back is undertaken to ascertain which control system has failed
  to deliver. Secondly appropriate actions are taken to ensure the problem doesn't
  reoccur, and thirdly the number of analyses increases dramatically so we are
  able to provide additional assurances both domestically and internationally
  that any problem has indeed been rectified. Where the supplier is found to
  be at fault, either through not complying with label directions or withholding
  periods, or through having inadequate management
  systems, then extra conditions of supply are placed on this farmer. These involve
  compulsory notification of the Inspector in Charge prior to sending any stock
  for slaughter so that the stock can be subjected to more intensive inspection
  and sampling, automatic condemnation of all offal, and/or retention of carcases
  until tested clear. Repeat offenders, or those blatantly disregarding the controls,
can face prosecution and or movement control notices being served on them.</p>
<p>Where
    the product or its label directions are found to be a contributing cause,
  a formal request is put to the Animal Remedies Board for a prioritised review
    of the withholding period and label of the product. Where there has been
  a failure in buyer / seller communication responsibility is put on the buyer
  to set up systems which prevent a reoccurrence. It is
    up to the buyer to initiate his/her own actions against the seller. Similarly,
    if a farmer claims his or her veterinarian failed to inform him or her of
    the
    relevant withholding period associated with the sale or administration of
    a prescription animal remedy (PAR) this is a civil matter between the farmer
  and this professional.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Consequences - overseas</p>
<p>&#8226; 
  Consignment rejections<br>
&#8226; 
  Reduced credibility<br>
&#8226; 
  Increased costs<br>
&#8226; 
  Market access restrictions<br>
&#8226; 
  Consumer backlash<br>
  The reaction of the importing country depends to some extent on the chemical
    residue found and the type of product it is found in. At the very least an
    explanation is requested on how product containing residues above their specifications
    is being certified to their market. Most regard the presence of excess residues
    in exported produce as evidence of lack of effective control by the exporting
    country's controlling authority. Accordingly, they reject the consignment
    and demand assurances and evidence of what will be done to prevent a reoccurrence.
    In the interim, trade restrictions and increased rates of testing at port
    of
    entry may be imposed. In some situations market access for that product type
    will be blocked. However, these are the government to government interactions.
  Increasingly, the real risk associated with residue detections is associated
  with the media
coverage and the inevitable consumer backlash this causes.</p>
