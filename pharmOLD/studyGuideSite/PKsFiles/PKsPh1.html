<p class="titleSG">Phase 1 metabolism</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> <br>
oxidative reactions (<a href="PKsPh1Hydrox.html">hydroxylation</a>, dealkylation, deamination)<br>
reductive reactions (rare)<br>
<a href="PKsPh1Hydrolys.html">hydrolytic reactions</a></p>
<p>These reactions generally produce a more reactive molecule which can then
  conjugate with a polar molecule in phase 2. Occasionally these reactive intermediates
  are toxic (eg, paracetamol).<br>
  Most phase 1 reactions take place in hepatocytes (so lipid soluble drugs have
  better access) catalysed by enzymes attached to the smooth endoplastic reticulum
  (microsomal enzymes). The most important of these is the cytochrome P450 system
  of enzymes (mixed function oxidase system). Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) usually
  carry out the first step of phase 1 which is then finished off by other enzymes.
  At least 50 different CYPs have been cloned in people and this work is starting
  to be carried out in dogs. They are grouped into different families depending
  on their homology, ie, CYP1, CYP2 etc. These are further divided into CYP2A,
  CYP2B etc, and then into CYP2A1, CYP2A2 etc. CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are commonest
  in people. They are reasonably non-specific in what they will metabolise, but
there are exceptions to this.</p>
<p>For many drugs in people, the specific enzyme
    in the P450 family which metabolises that drug is known. This can be useful
    to know if you also know that the person
    is deficient in that enzyme, which is fairly common. This also happens in
  dogs (and probably other species). For instance, celecoxib, an aspirin type
  drug,
    is metabolised in dogs by CYP2D15 (thought to correspond to CYP2D6 in people).
    However, only 45% of dogs possess this enzyme and they metabolise celecoxib
much faster than the rest.</p>
<p>Cytochrome P450s are also present in the intestinal
mucosa, and can metabolise some drugs before they reach the systemic circulation.</p>
