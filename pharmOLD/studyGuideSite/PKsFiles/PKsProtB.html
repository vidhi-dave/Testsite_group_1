<p class="titleSG">Protein binding</p>
<p>Once many drugs get into the plasma, they bind to plasma proteins, especially
  albumin. Plasma albumin is particularly important in binding acidic drugs;
  basic drugs may be bound by &#946; globulin and acid glycoprotein. Binding depends
on:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>drug concentration<br>
    affinity for the binding sites<br>
  protein concentration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is usually a much larger number of binding sites
      than molecules of drug to bind to them, but this can change if there is
    a low concentration of albumin
    (liver disease) or if many of the binding sites are already occupied by another
    highly protein bound drug. This is clinically important since it is the free
    (unbound) proportion of the drug which can move into the target tissue and
    is thus active. If you give a drug which is normally 98% protein bound leaving
    2% to produce the expected effects, if the binding sites are not available
    the amount of free drug may be dramatically different from expected and the
    effects may be much greater. This can cause embarassment if the owner is
    watching. However, most modern drugs are so potent (ie, work at very low
    concentration)
    that displacement is rare. Old drugs such as sulphonamides and phenylbutazone
    can occupy clinically significant numbers of binding sites.<br>
  Protein bound drug is also unavailable for metabolism (but if the free drug
    is metabolised, some bound drug will quickly take its place, so this is not
  a limit on metabolism).</p>
