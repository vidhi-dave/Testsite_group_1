<p class="titleSG">Dissolution</p>
<p>The solubility of the drug is important in determining the rate of drug absorption.
  Solubility is a function of the molecular structure of the drug and the fluid
  surrounding it. Solubility can be altered by forming salts of the drug; eg,
  morphine chloride is more soluble than morphine sulphate and both are much
  more soluble than morphine base. For weak acids or weak bases the solubility
  of the drug varies with the drug's pKa and the environmental pH of the medium
  in which the drug is dissolved. This pH varies from site to site along the
  gastrointestinal tract and in similar sites between species (the rumen has
  a pH of about 8.5; the monogastric&#8217;s stomach about 1.5). Exercise and
inflammation can alter pH at injection sites.</p>
<p>The solubility of drugs might
    vary from one proprietary preparation to another since the formulations may
    have different excipients or a different pH. Many
    drugs are prepared as relatively insoluble salts to ensure a slow absorption
    and a prolonged effect. Some are suspensions of finely divided particles;
  these give a sustained release but will block arterioles if injected iv (eg
  lente
insulin). </p>
<p>Formulation of the drug is very important for oral preparations.
    Some tablets are coated to protect them from acid in the stomach; they then
    dissolve in
      the intestine where the pH is completely different. The particle size will
      affect the rate of dissolution (bigger is slower), the excipient (often
  lactose) will affect how quickly the tablet breaks up. An extreme example is
  trace
  element supplements for ruminants, where the excipient is sometimes glass!</p>
<p>Some
    drugs are practically insoluble in water and are dissolved in lipid emulsions
    or other vehicles for injection. Some of these vehicles can be
      dangerous in
      some species, eg, polyethoxylated castor oil will cause massive histamine
      release in dogs (the same thing can happen in other species, but the risk
      is acceptably
      low). Oily injection diluents can act as depots from which the drug is
  slowly leached. The lipid solubility of the drug and the nature of the oil
  determine
      the absorption. Waxes are often used for situations such as dry cow intramammary
      preparations where a slow release of drug is required (typically 30 days).
      Where extremely slow absorption is required (100 days), such as growth
  promoting hormone implants, silicone rubber is used. A variety of plastics
  are used
      for intravaginal delivery of hormones in cattle and sheep, these implants
      usually
      have a string attached and are pulled out when they have finished delivering
      the drug.<br>
      <a href="PKsDissPic.html">Mechanical devices</a> such as osmotic pumps are occasionally used. These are
      capsules containing a compartment with a hypertonic solution and a semipermeable
      membrane
      open to the ECF. As fluid diffuses across the membrane the hypertonic compartment
      expands, pushing the drug out of the other end of the device. These give
      accurate drug delivery which can act over several months but are expensive.
      Similar
      pumps are used for slow delivery in the rumen of oral drugs such as anthelmintics
and trace elements. </p>
<p>Implanting devices to release a drug a a precise rate
    in the right place is likely to increase in the future; pumps with electric
    motors are increasingly
        being used in people for insulin administration and have been tried in
cattle for hormone manipulation.</p>
<p>Drugs for intravenous injection bypass
    the dissolution process so they must already be dissolved in water, or in
  a form which will quickly dissolve
          once
          injected. Relatively fat soluble drugs are usually in the form of an
          emulsion, so the drug is at least miscible with the plasma. Emulsifiers
          used like
this can often cause side effects.</p>
<p>Drugs which are not in solution or
    in an emulsion of some sort should <strong>not</strong> be given iv.<br>
