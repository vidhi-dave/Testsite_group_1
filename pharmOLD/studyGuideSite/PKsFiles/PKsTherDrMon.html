<p class="titleSG">Therapeutic drug monitoring</p>
<p>Therapeutic drug monitoring is appropriate as a clinical tool only under certain,
well defined conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; when the drug of interest has a narrow safety index (i.e. therapeutic
    plasma concentrations are very close to toxic plasma concentrations), e.g.
    gentamicin,
    digoxin<br>
&#8226; when the therapeutic effect of the drug of interest is difficult or impractical
    to monitor, or would require an extended period of individual trial and dose
    adjustment, e.g. phenobarbitone for epilepsy<br>
&#8226; when the drug's half-life or clearance is likely to change as a result
of its use, or the co-admistration of other drugs, e.g. phenobarbitone, phenytoin<br>
&#8226; when the drug's distribution or elimination cannot be predicted<br>
    (i)because of pre-existing or on-going disease, e.g. liver or kidney disease,
  or<br>
  (ii)because of 'unusual' physiology, such as in neonates or in pregnant animals<br>
&#8226; when there has been a failure of the drug to induce the expected therapeutic
  results<br>
&#8226; when there is the suspicion that the drug is not being administered as
directed, i.e. breakdown of client compliance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring
  in any of these situations is based on the assumption that the therapeutic
  efficacy or toxicity of a drug is a direct
  function of its plasma concentration. This assumption is fundamental, since
  it is the plasma drug concentration which is measured, but it does not hold
  true
  for all drugs, eg NSAIDs. The target plasma concentrations must be obtained
  from the literature (beware - human figures are often used and assumed to be
  valid
  for other species); a further assumption is that these are appropriate for
  the individual patient being treated. In the end you have to use your clinical
  skill
and judgement!</p>
