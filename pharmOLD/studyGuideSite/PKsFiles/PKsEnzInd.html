<p class="titleSG">Enzyme induction</p>
<p>The rate at which metabolism proceeds can be altered by drugs. Some drugs,
  such as phenobarbitone, cause a greatly increased synthesis of cytochrome P450
  and glucuronyl transferase which means that the phenobarbitone (and other drugs)
  will be metabolised much more quickly (up to five times faster). This process
  is known as induction. It is of great clinical importance: many dogs are given
  phenobarbitone chronically for epilepsy, if they are then given some other
  drug the duration of action of the other drug may be much shorter than expected.
  Brassicas (rape, kale etc) also contain compounds which induce P450 enzymes.
  Grapefruit juice is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes in people, but it is
  not often drunk by animals! Ketoconazole, usually used as an antifungal drug,
  also inhibits CYP3A4, and is sometimes used to prolong the effects of expensive
  drugs in dogs. Macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and clarithromycin
also inhibit CYP3A4 in people. Fluoxetine (an antidepressant) inhibits CYP2D6.</p>
<p>The
    rate of drug metabolism is also altered by changes in liver blood flow. These
  can occur in heart disease or shock, or can be caused by drugs.</p>
<p>Some drugs
    are metabolised so rapidly by the liver that they cannot be given orally.
  They are taken up by the portal system and most or all of the drug
      is metabolised by one passage through the liver so that very little or
  no drug appears in the systemic circulation. This is known as first pass metabolism.
      It is important for drugs like lignocaine (all removed) and morphine (about
    80% removed).</p>
<p>Although most drug metabolism takes place in the liver, other
    organs (eg, skin, kidneys) are clinically important for some drugs. Intestinal
    lining
        cells may
      also be important in first pass metabolism.</p>
