<p class="titleSG">Residues - introduction</p>
<p>After a drug has been administered and reached peak concentration, the amount
  of drug in the body usually declines exponentially.This means that most of
  the drug is removed fairly quickly, but the last bit takes a long time. (If
  the decline was truly exponential, the concentration would never reach zero.)
  Since most large animals will eventually be eaten, there is a danger of consumers
ingesting some drug in their meat or milk.</p>
<p>International and domestic markets
  have a right to expect that the food animal products they are buying are safe,
  wholesome, and true to label. However, residue
  testing is being used more today to control access to markets than it is for
  food safety. Europe has led the way in this but the rest of the world is following.
  The general public has a grossly distorted perception of the relative risks
that residues pose to their health.</p>
<p>What constitutes a food animal varies from
  country to country. Because the French eat horses, horses are classified internationally
  as a food species
  and are subject to the full range of regulation. (The same does not apply to
Koreans and dogs - yet!)</p>
<p>One way of removing the problem of residues would be
  to test every animal slaughtered and the milk from every cow (at every milking)
  for all the possible drugs each
  animal may have had. This is obviously not possible, although that does not
  stop some people advocating this approach. New Zealand relies on an &#8220;integrated
  quality assurance approach&#8221; (to
  use MAF speak). This includes having a registration process for veterinary
  medicines and agrichemicals which is geared towards international market requirements,
  well informed users (ie, vets and farmers), and some law on which to base enforcement
  activities. Rather than being a screen, residue testing in New Zealand is regarded
  as an audit of both the effectiveness of the controls put in place, and of
  farmer compliance with the relevant conditions of use. This system relies heavily
on vets using drugs responsibly and making sure that farmers do the same.</p>
<p>Different
    foods are treated differently for historical reasons. Milk residues are usually
    dealt with by the dairy industry, most of the rest is covered by the Food
  Safety Authority, which is officially part of MAF but comes under the Minister
  of Health. </p>
<p>Residues may also come from other sources, eg pesticides,
    environmental contamination (particularly heavy metals) and plant and fungal
    toxins. Problems can arise
        when a fungal toxin in pasture is the same thing as a drug produced by
fungal cultures in a lab.</p>
