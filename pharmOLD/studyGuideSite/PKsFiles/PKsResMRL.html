<p class="titleSG">Residues - maximum residue levels</p>
<p>Current analytical techniques (usually HPLC) are so sensitive that it is possible
  to detect some residue of a drug even years after its administration if you
  look hard enough. This means that there must be an allowable level of drug
  in food which is considered &#8220;safe&#8221;. Since safety is rather subjective,
  it is not surprising that different countries choose different levels (and
  call them different things). Eventually, everyone may follow the World Health
  Organisation&#8217;s Codex Alimentarius, but at the moment Europe and the USA
  have different but parallel systems to the WHO: Australia and NZ have a half
  way house where some levels are different again. The WHO and EU call the &#8220;safe&#8221; amounts
  of drug in food the maximum residue level (MRL). You must know about these,
  since exports from NZ must conform to Codex, or failing that, EU MRLs. These
  are also accepted for imported food. Food for the domestic market is currently
  subject to different MRLs. There are moves afoot to sort out this situation,
but don&#8217;t hold your breath.</p>
<p class="footerSG">How are MRLs calculated?</p>
<p>First the <strong><a name="adi"></a>acceptable daily intake</strong> (ADI) value for
  each chemical is established. The ADI is calculated from chronic toxicology
  studies on at least two species
  of laboratory animals. These animals are given different doses of the drug
  and the highest dose which produces no effect is called the <strong><a name="noel"></a>no observed
  effect level</strong> (NOEL). For antibiotics, the effects examined are changes in the gut
flora, either the normal flora or axenic mice with human gut flora added.</p>
<p>For
  most chemicals the ADI is based on the amount the average human could consume
  for their entire life and still show no observable effect. This involves using
  the animal NOELs and multiplying by various fudge factors (usually 100) to
  increase safety. Drugs which are potentially carcinogenic cannot have an ADI
  since it is assumed that one molecule could be enough to start a tumour. This
  raises problems when those drugs are also naturally present in man and animals,
  eg oestrogen. Different countries deal differently with such drugs: they are
  banned in Europe, given very low MRLs in the USA, and generally ignored in
NZ in the hope that they will go away.</p>
<p>The first principle of establishing MRL
  values is that they should be set low enough for each food type so that the
  ADI will never be exceeded by anyone
  eating a diet made up of foods which could conceivably contain these residues.
  The  NZ Food Safety Authority has tables showing
  the &#8220;average&#8221; diet of different ethnic groups in NZ. The second
  principle currently applied is that they should be further restricted to that
  level which is required if they are used in accordance with 'good agricultural
practice'. This term is not defined.</p>
