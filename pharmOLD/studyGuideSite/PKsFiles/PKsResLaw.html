<p class="titleSG">Residues - overview of the law</p>
<p>NZ law on residues is rather confusing since so many different <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/">acts
    of parliament</a>  and regulations made under those acts are involved. These are starting to be
  consolidated under the Animal Products Act, but there is still some way to
  go. The recently established <a href="http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/">NZ Food Safety
  Authority </a>overseas all this, as
  well as the licensing of veterinary medicines.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary
    Medicines Act (1997)</p>
<p>It is an offence
  for vets to fail to provide a client with information to prevent the occurrence
of residues ($15,000 fine).</p>
<p class="footerSG">Food Regulations (1984 / 262) made under the Food
Act (1981)</p>
<p>Milk must not contain any added substance nor any trace of an antibiotic
  substance.Regulation 257 sets MRLs of &#8220;incidental constituents&#8221;,
  which include some veterinary medicines. The MRL for an unspecified pesticide
  or veterinary medicine
  is 0.1ppm. Imported foods must comply with the MRLs set by the WHO&#8217;s
Codex Alimentarius Commission.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Meat (Residues) Regulations (1<span class="footerSG">9</span>96 / 199) made
under the Meat Act (1981)</p>
<p>These were designed to fill in some of the gaps in
  other legislation. They set MRLs (but call them maximum permitted levels) of
  drug residues in NZ: licensed
  animal remedies - 0.01ppm (&micro;g/ml), unlicensed animal remedies - 0.001ppm,
  specified drugs have individual MRLs set. Note that these MRLs are often different
  from those used in Europe and America (and the Codex).<br>
  It is an offence to submit animals for slaughter with residues present greater
  than the MRLs or inside the with holding period.<br>
  The Director General of MAF may decree that animals treated with some groups
  of drugs must be permanently identified (currently hormonal growth promoters
  and Johne&#8217;s vaccine) (it is also an offence to use officially sanctioned
  ear tags for anything else).It is illegal to use a drug to promote growth unless
  it is licensed for that.<br>
  Anyone selling a treated animal must tell the buyer.<br>
  MAF can control movement of animals.<br>
These regs cover meat from most animals, including horses, but not fish.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Dairy
Industry Act (1952) and Dairy Industry Regulations (1990 / 290)</p>
<p>These mainly
    relate to quality and hygiene, but are written vaguely enough to cover drug
    residues as well. Dairy products must not be sold or exported
      if they are likely to endanger public health. Milk purchasers may take
samples for analysis. Milk and dairy products must be fit for human consumptionion.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Animal
Products Act 1999</p>
<p>This is supposed to replace the previous acts and regulations
    with mandatory food standards. These will probably be very similar, but have
    not been
published yet. They were due to come into force in November 2002!</p>
<p class="footerSG">Overseas
information</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/cvm/">USA</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.eudra.org/vetdocs/vets/mrl.htm">Europe</a><br>
  <br>
  When looking at overseas information, remember that MRLs may be different
              from here, and that different formulations of the same drug may
    have different withholding
              times.<br>
