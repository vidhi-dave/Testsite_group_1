<p class="titleSG"><a id="top" name="top"></a>Basic toxicology</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="definitions" name="definitions"></a>Definitions <span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>Poison: any solid, liquid or gas that regardless of the route of exposure (oral, topical, inhaled etc) causes a harmful effect on the body (also know as toxicant).<br>
			Poisoning: occurs when the poison produces a clinical effect in the animal.<br>
			Toxin: generally used to describe poisons that come from biological sources. For example the tetanus bacteria produces a (bio)toxin that causes lockjaw in humans and animals.<br>
			Antitoxin: an antibody to the toxin of a microorganism (or zootoxin or phytotoxin) that specifically binds to the toxin and neutralises it; eg. Tetanus antitoxin is derived from injecting toxin into animals and collecting the antibodies for therapeutic use that is to bind the toxin in the sick animal.<br>
			Toxicity: refers to the amount of poison necessary to have harmful effects.<br>
			All substances are potentially toxic if given in sufficient quantities. The LD50 (lethal dose 50%) is an expression of the amount of compound that is necessary to cause death to half the animals exposed to the compound. <br>
			NOEL: no observed effect level <br>
			NOEAL: no observed adverse effect level<br>
			GRAS: generally regarded as safe<br>
			Dose: The amount of toxicant (poison) that is received per animal.<br>
			Dosage: The amount of toxicant per unit of animal mass or weight. (mg/kg)</p>
		<p>For example it takes 25 mg/kg (LD50)of the anticoagulant brodifacoum to cause death in half the cats that ingest that quantity.  That means a 5 kg cat would need to eat 125 mg of brodifacoum to have a fatal outcome in 50% of cats ingesting that amount. However Talon, which contains brodifacoum, is not 100% brodifacoum. It contains fillers that are attractive to rodents. The bait has 50 mg of active ingredient per kilogram of bait. Therefore a 5 kg cat would have to eat 2.5 kilograms of Talon but a 5 kg dog (LD50 for dog is 0.25-3.6 mg/kg) could eat as little as 25 grams of Talon to poison it. In reality the cat could be fatally poisoned by much less brodifacoum depending on the site of bleeding (e.g. brain haemorrhage).</p>
		<p>A toxic effect can be defined as any noxious effect on the body &#150; reversible or irreversible; any chemically induced tumour-benign or malignant; any mutagenic or teratogenic effect or death as a result of contact with a substance via the respiratory tract, skin, eye, mouth, injection or any other route.<br>
			Toxic effects are undesirable alterations to the body&rsquo;s function (physiology) caused by a poison or toxin.<br>Antidote: a substance that specifically counters the action of a poison. (e.g. vitamin K for anticoagulant poisons).<br>
			Therapeutic Index: 	LD50 The larger the index the safer the compound.<br>

		<p class="footerSG"><a id="doseResponse" name="doseResponse"></a>Dose-Response Relationship<span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>In a true dose-response relationship there is a measurable effect that is proportional to the quantity of poison received. Several assumptions are made in this regard:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An interaction between the compounds and a molecule or receptor produces a response.
			<li>That response is correlated to the concentration (amount) of chemical at the receptor.
			<li>The concentration of the compound at the site of action is associated with the dose given.
		</ul>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="toxClass" name="toxClass"></a>Toxicity Classes<span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>1. Extremely toxic-only takes a small amount to kill, e.g. less than 1mg per kg of body weight<br>
			2.	Highly toxic &#150; from 1 to 50 mg per kg is deadly.<br>
			3.	Moderately toxic &#150; 50 to 500 mg per kg is deadly.<br>
			4.	Slightly toxic &#150; 500 mg to 5 grams per kg is deadly.<br>
			5.	Practically nontoxic &#150; 5 to 15 grams per kg is deadly.<br>
			Relatively harmless &#150; more than 15 grams per kg is required to cause poisoning or death.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="expose" name="expose"></a>Exposure<span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>1. Acute &#150; the effects of a single dose or multiple doses that cause signs of poisoning during a 24-hour period. The LD50 is usually calculated from acute poisoning research.<br>
			2.	Subacute &#150; repeated exposure to a poison for more than 24 hours up to 30 days.<br>
			Sub Chronic &#150; exposure lasting from 1-3 months.<br>
			Chronic &#150; refers to exposure to (a poison) or the effects of (poisoning) that occur for 3 months or longer.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="routes" name="routes"></a>Routes of Poisoning</p>
		<p>Ingestion (per mouth)<br>
			Inhalation (gases, particles in the air)<br>
			Skin (topical)<br>
			Iatrogenic (given by someone includes oral but also injectable methods such as intravenous or intramuscular.)</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="spp" name="spp"></a>Species, breed, sex and age differences<span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>Selective toxicity: Not all animals respond the same to a poison. As in the previous example cats are more resistant to anticoagulant rodenticides than dogs. Metabolism of a compound may cause one species to be more susceptible to poisons than another. Aspirin toxicity in the cat is due to the low capacity of the liver, specifically the enzyme glucuronyl transferase, to metabolise and therefore eliminate aspirin. Aspirin can be given safely to a cat when the T1/2 (half-life) of 20+ hours is taken into account when dosing.</p>
		<p>Some breeds are more sensitive to a given poison than another. Examples include collie dogs poisoned by a normal dose of the parasiticide ivermectin that has no toxic effect on a Labrador; or Brahman cattle that are more sensitive to organophosphorus insecticides than Hereford or Friesian.</p>
		<p>Some poisons are more toxic to one sex than the other sex. For example female dogs are more sensitive to monensin (a feed additive for growth promotion in cattle) than male dogs.<br>
			Age: young and old animals tend to be more sensitive to poisons than normal adults.</p>
		<p>Healthy individuals are less sensitive to some poisons than sickly or debilitated animals.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="principles" name="principles"></a>Principles of Veterinary Toxicology<span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>1. Stabilise the animal &#150; Provide symptomatic care to ensure that the animal&rsquo;s functions (heart, breathing/airway etc) are maintained<br>
			2.	Limit Exposure &#150; remove animal from poisoned environment e.g. move cattle from pasture high in nitrates.<br>
			3.	Limit absorption &#150; apply decontamination principles to remove poison from site of exposure (e.g. skin-wash off; oral-give activated charcoal or laxative)<br>
				4.	Promote elimination-fluid diuresis may remove some poisons via the urine.<br>
			5. Identify the poison-whenever possible try to identify the poison, have owner bring in container or sample of poison but caution owner to use gloves, sealed containers or any method of transport to prevent poisoning to themselves.</p>
		<p class="footerSG"><a id="treat" name="treat"></a>Treatment<span class="top"><a href="#top">top</a href></span></p>
		<p>Successful treatment depends on four principles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identify the type of poison.
			<li>Prevent further absorption of the poison.
			<li>Treat the symptoms (but with regard to the poison if it is known). That is: &ldquo;TREAT THE PATIENT NOT THE POISON!&rdquo;
			<li>Give an antidote if one is available.
		</ul>
		<p class="sgH3">Identifying the Poison</p>
		<p>Try to establish the poison by history, clinical signs or suspicions. It is important to know whether a corrosive material has been swallowed (acid or alkali) as these burn the oesophagus and animals should not be given an emetic as this will increase the severity of the injury. Caustic compounds-give milk or water.</p>
		<p class="sgH3">Prevent further absorption</p>
		<p>Proper decontamination is the key to successful therapy and outcomes.<br>
				Prevent further exposure to the poison. Move animals or restrict access to the area.<br>
				Induce vomiting if it is safe to do so. (some species cannot vomit)<br>
			i.   only effective if within 4 hours of ingestion of the poison see chart for home treatment to induce vomiting.<br>
			In the veterinary clinic for small animals a gastric lavage (rinse the stomach)  is used to remove any material left in the stomach.<br>
			i.   gastric lavage requires an anaesthetic and proper intubation (with cuffed endotracheal tube) to prevent aspiration pneumonia. <br>
			ii.   Warm water or saline is used to flush out stomach contents.<br>
			Use a binding agent to prevent the gastrointestinal tract from absorbing the poison. For most poisons activated charcoal works very well.  A laxative to &ldquo;flush&rdquo; the activated charcoal and bound poison through the gastrointestinal tract will speed the removal process.<br>
				Prevent the absorption of external poisons:<br>
			i.   Non-oily compounds-wash with copious amounts of water.<br>
			ii.  Liquid/oily compounds (like oil)-use liquid paraffin or cooking oil on the skin, working in well and then wash the animal with a mild detergent (e.g. mild liquid dishwashing soap) and warm water until the evidence of the compound is removed. <br>
			iii. Solid oily contamination (tar-like compounds)-when possible clip away small areas of contaminated fur such as tar balls between foot pads. Use liquid paraffin, cooking oil or butter and work into the coat. Wash thoroughly but keep warm to avoid hypothermia.</p>
		<p class="sgH3">Symptomatic Care</p>
		<p>Treat the patient&rsquo;s clinical signs (eg rehydrate if dehydrated). The symptomatic care may be the only treatment known for a particular poison (e.g. metaldehyde has no known antidote).</p>
		<p class="sgH3">Antidotes</p>
		<p>There are very few poisons that have a specific antidote to reverse the clinical signs of poisoning. Vitamin K is specific for anticoagulant poisons like Talon (brodifacoum). Atropine is used to block acetyl choline receptors in the autonomic nervous system to prevent some of the clinical signs of organophosphorus and carbamate insecticide poisonings.</p>
