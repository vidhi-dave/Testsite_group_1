    <td valign="top"><p>Most drugs and their metabolites are excreted in the kidney. 
        Biliary excretion is also important for some drugs. Most drugs (except 
        those that are highly protein bound) are freely filtered in the glomerulus. 
        There are also transporter systems in the proximal tubules which actively 
        excrete some drugs (especially weak acids), even when they are protein 
        bound. Competition can occur for these carriers and one drug can have 
        a major effect on the excretion of another, eg probenecid has been used 
        to block the excretion of penicillin.<br>
        Polar drugs and metabolites do not cross the tubule walls easily and are 
        therefore concentrated in the urine as the water is reaborbed. pH and 
        thus ionisation is important here - basic drugs are more rapidly excreted 
        in an acid urine because they will be more highly ionised and thus not 
        reaborbed. With acidic drugs the opposite is true. Since the urine pH 
        can be altered with drugs, the concentration of some drugs in the urine 
        can be altered. This can be important in treating urinary tract infections. 
        Some drugs such as frusemide, penicillins and digoxin are excreted unchanged 
        by the kidney - they are polar enough without metabolism.<br>
        If the kidney is not working properly (common in old age) then drug excretion 
        will be reduced.<br>
        Conjugates (usually glucuronides) can be subject to enterohepatic recirculation.</p>

      the plasma concentration of most drugs falls exponentially<br>
      &#8226; 
      a drug&#8217;s half life is the time for the drug concentration to fall
      by (to) half<br>
      &#8226; 
      nearly all the drug is gone after 5 half lives - but residues may still
      be above MRL<br>
&#8226;      with repeated dosing,
      a steady state is reached after about 5 half lives<br>
      &#8226; 
      some drugs show a biexponential decay corresponding to distribution and
    elimination</td>
