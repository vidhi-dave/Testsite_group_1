<p class="titleSG">Phase 2 metabolism</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> conjugation with<br>
  <a href="PKsPh2Gluc.html">glucuronide</a> (not cats)<br>
sulphate (not pigs)<br>
methyl<br>
acetyl (not dogs and cats)<br>
glycine<br>
glutamine (mainly man)<br>
ornithine (birds only)</p>
<p>These reactions occur when a molecule has a suitable reactive group for the
  attachment of a substituent group. Although the reactive group is usually put
  there by phase 1 reactions, some drugs can be conjugated without going through
phase 1. These reactions also take place mostly in the liver.</p>
<p><a href="PKsPh2Gluc.html">Glucuronidation</a>,
    the commonest reaction, is catalysed by glucuronyl transferase (except in
  cats which do not possess this enzyme); acetylation by acetyl coenzyme
A and methylation by S adenosyl methionine. There are major species differences
    in phase two reactions - see list above. There are probably also major individual
    differences (there certainly are
in people).</p>
<p>Phase 2 reactions can be reversed. Etorphine is conjugated with
    glucuronide in most species and a significant amount is excreted in the bile
    where
        it is exposed to the gut bacteria. These bacteria can lop off the glucuronide,
        allowing
        etorphine to be reabsorbed (and thus produce a second set of effects
  - in
        the case of etorphine this is sedation). This process is called enterohepatic
recirculation.</p>
<p>Drugs are usually metabolised by several different pathways
so the end result is a range of different metabolites.</p>
<p>Newborn animals do
    not possess many of the enzymes required for drug metabolism. This can be
  important, eg during caesarian section, anaesthetics
            will cross
            the placenta as well as the blood brain barrier; since the newborn
      animals have no enzymes to metabolise the anaesthetics, they may suffer
  from prolonged sedation which will not increase their chances of survival.
            (The answer
            is to use drugs which are eliminated without metabolism, such as
  inhalation anaesthetics.) Older children usually metabolise drugs faster than
  adults, this has not been shown in animals (but no-one has looked). Old animals
  and particularly animals with liver disease also tend to metabolise drugs slowly.
  Some individuals also lack the necessary
            enzymes
            - but this
is usually discovered after the drug has been given!</p>
