<p class="caption">Movement of drugs in the body. Drug concentrations are usually measured in
  plasma (because it is easier) rather than the target tissue, which would be
  more useful. The liver is not the only organ which metabolises drugs, but it
  is probably most important for most drugs.<br>
</p>
<p>These processes differ between animals of different species, age, sex, health
  status and size, and within an individual from time to time.<br>
  Understanding pharmacokinetics is important because unless the drug reaches
  a sufficient concentration at the target cells it will not work. If the concentration
  at other sites is high enough, you will get side effects. The effect is usually
  proportional to plasma concentration rather than dose (absorption can be very
  variable).<br>
  It is useful to think of the body as a number of compartments with barriers
  between them that the drug has to cross to get from the site of administration
  to the target tissue and then out of the body.<br>
  Consider a cat that has been bitten on the tail by another cat. These puncture
  wounds are usually infected with Pasteurella spp. and an abscess will form
  rapidly unless the bacteria are killed with an antibiotic (usually penicillin).
  To kill the bacteria, there must be a sufficient concentration of penicillin
  in the fluid bathing them for a sufficient length of time. It is not usually
  possible to apply the penicillin directly to the bacteria; the cat is usually
  given a tablet or injection which means that the penicillin has to get from
  the cat's stomach or the injection site to the extracellular fluid around the
  bite in the tail and stay there for long enough to kill the bacteria. In the
  meantime, the cat's kidneys will be doing their best to get rid of the penicillin
  into the urine.<br>
  The penicillin thus has to be absorbed from the stomach or injection site,
  distributed to the tail (and other tissues) and eliminated by the kidneys (penicillin
  is not metabolised to any great extent). Penicillin is a very safe drug so
  the simplest way of ensuring that the bacteria are killed is to overdose the
  cat. With most drugs however, overdosing will cause serious problems with side
  effects: getting exactly the right concentration of drug in the target tissue
  requires a knowledge of pharmacokinetics. It is largely a matter of giving
  the right amount of drug by the right route for that particular animal, and
  requires skill and judgement since no two animals are exactly the same.<br>
