  <tr> 
    <td valign="top"><p>The main route that the body uses to get rid of drugs 
        is via the kidney. Lipophilic drugs are easily reabsorbed in the kidney, 
        so drugs are usually metabolised to a more polar metabolite before elimination, 
        although some drugs are eliminated unchanged, eg penicillin, which is 
        a weak acid. Most metabolism takes place in the liver, but other organs 
        such as the lungs and kidneys, and even the skin, can be important. Metabolism 
        usually inactivates a drug; exceptions to this are prodrugs; these are 
        inactive and have to be converted to the active metabolite to have an 
        effect, for instance, the sedative chloral hydrate has to be converted 
        to trichloroethanol before any effects are seen. Some active drugs also 
        have active metabolites, eg, the sedative diazepam.<br>
        Modern drugs are sometimes given as lipid soluble prodrugs, then converted 
        to the active drug at the site of action, and hopefully trapped there. 
        Most angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors given to dogs with heart 
        failure are prodrugs. </p>
      <p>Metabolism usually occurs in two phases:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong><a href="PKsPh1.html">Phase 1</a></strong> <br>
          oxidative reactions (hydroxylation, dealkylation, deamination)<br>
          reductive reactions (rare)<br>
          hydrolytic reactions</p>
        <p><strong><a href="PKsPh2.html">Phase 2</a></strong> conjugation with<br>
          glucuronide (not cats)<br>
          sulphate (not pigs)<br>
          methyl<br>
          acetyl (not dogs and cats)<br>
          glycine<br>
          glutamine (mainly man)<br>
          ornithine (birds only)</p>

      &#8226; 
      most drugs are metabolised in two phases - they have a &#8220;reactive
      handle&#8221; attached by a cytochrome P450 enzyme which is then conjugated
      with a water soluble molecule - usually glucuronide.<br>
      &#8226; 
      some drugs will induce increased production of P450 which will increase
      the rate of metabolism.<br>
      &#8226; 
      produgs have to be metabolised to produce their action.<br>
      &#8226; 
    liver disease usually slows metabolism<br></td>
