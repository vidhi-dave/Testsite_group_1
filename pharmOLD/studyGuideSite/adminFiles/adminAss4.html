		<p>The WebCT test will consist of 50 multiple choice questions. The large number of very specific questions is designed to test your breadth of knowledge. Details of how to access this will be given later.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">How much do you need to know for examinations?</p>
		<p>It is not possible to rote learn a therapeutic recipe for every possible disease 
  in every possible species a veterinary surgeon might encounter, although most 
  students have a miserable couple of years trying to do this. It is important 
  that you can rationally choose appropriate therapy for a pathophysiological 
  state with which you have no previous experience. This course should provide 
  the initial structured learning which will enable you to both develop the skills 
  and to obtain the knowledge necessary to become competent in the treatment of 
  animals with drugs.<br>
  You will come across lots of drug names. <strong>Do not try to learn them all!</strong> 
  It is worth trying to classify these into several groups:<br>
  <em><strong>emergency drugs</strong></em> - you should know what these drugs 
  do, when to give them and at what dose. Fortunately only adrenaline, morphine, 
  diazepam and iv fluids fall into this category, and the choice and initial dose 
  rate of fluid is not critical.<br>
  <em><strong>commonly used drugs</strong></em> - you should know what these drugs 
  do and when to give them. <br>
  <em><strong>rarely used drugs</strong></em> - you should know that these exist 
  and where to get more information about them<br>
  The examination is designed to test the application of knowledge gained through 
  the course, primarily within realistic common case scenarios encountered in 
  veterinary clinical practice. This means that you must be able to apply your 
  knowledge, not just regurgitate it. If you have a working understanding of the 
  study guide and some common sense, you should pass easily. (You have to try 
  hard to fail!!) If you memorise the study guide, you may get up to 90%. If you 
  want to get 100%, you will have to read around the subject, including the more 
  scientific journals. </p>
<p class="footer">These notes are designed as reference material and contain more 
  detail than is required to pass the examinations. Attempts to memorise them 
  are a sign of stupidity.</p>
<p>There will be no mid term exam. You are expected to assess how you are getting on by answering the practice questions at the end of each chapter and marking them yourself using the answers at the back of the study guide.</p>
