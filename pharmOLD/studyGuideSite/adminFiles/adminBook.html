			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Brander, Pugh et al: Veterinary applied pharmacology and therapeutics 5th ed (1991)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">This is a reasonable textbook but rather out of date.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Madison, Page &amp; Church (eds) Small animal clinical pharmacology (2002)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">A multi-author book which attempts, reasonably sucessfully, to be both an undergarduate pharmacology book and a clinical reference text. Not cheap.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Medimedia (NZ) Ltd: IVS Annual (2005)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">A collection of most (but not all) of the package insert information for veterinary drugs available in NZ. Useful as a veterinary reference book to find out what&rsquo;s available. For human drugs you need to look elsewhere (e.g. MIMS). Most of the veterinary info will soon be available on the www at: <span class="CharURL">http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/acvm/registers-lists/acvm-register/index.htm</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Bishop (ed) The Veterinary Formulary 5th ed (2000) &amp; 6th ed (2005)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">A very useful book organised on a systems / therapeutic indication basis. Dose rates for veterinary drugs and human drugs commonly used in animals. Although published in Britain, the 5th ed also covers European, American, Australian and NZ drugs, but the 6th only covers UK ones. As a general rule, drugs available here are a subset of those available in Britain. Good book but expensive.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Plumb: Veterinary Drug Handbook 4th ed (2002)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Excellent reference for dose rates, indications, contra-indications and toxicity, This is a collection of dose rates from most reputable veterinary medicine texts and from some refereed articles. It also includes some human drugs used in animals. It is organised alphabetically by drug name, so it is not much use for finding out what drugs can be used for a particular problem. The information is well referenced, so you can go to the primary source if you wish. However, some drugs commonly used here are not available in the USA, so are not included in Plumb. This is currently the cheapest of the useful reference books.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">University of Sydney Foundation for Continuing Education: Pharmacological Bases of Veterinary Therapeutics Proceedings 198 (1992)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">These are the notes from a refresher course in clinical pharmacology held in Jun 1992. The proceedings are a fairly comprehensive discourse on a systems basis. This is a useful text.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Lorenz et al.: Small Animal Medical Therapeutics (1992)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">This text presents current and experimental treatment</p>

			<p class="ParBodytext">for organ systems in an orderly and organised fashion. However, the content reflects the bias of the authors, and since each chapter is written by a different person, there are some areas of inconsistency. Some chapters are much better than others. This book contains a very useful table of dose rates for a large number of drugs.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Adams: Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics 8th Ed (2001)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Comprehensive but exorbitantly expensive. Good for weight lifting.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Bonagura: Kirk&rsquo;s Current Veterinary Therapy Small Animal Practice XIII (2000)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Current Veterinary Therapy Food animal practice (1999)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Despite the names, these are a cross between a medicine and pharmacology book. They are written as clinical reviews of specific subjects, and contain much useful clinical information, backed up by a little science. There are tables of drug doses at the back.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">For antibiotics only (covered in second semester):</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">P<span style="font-weight: bold; ">rescott, Baggot and Walker, Antimicrobial Therapy in veteriny medicine. 3rd ed. Iowa State University Press (2000)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Probably the most comprehensive book on veterinary antibiotics. Worth getting out of the library but not worth buying.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Cooper (Ed): Antimicrobial prescribing guidelines for veterinarians 2nd ed (1999)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">Useful reference for antimicrobial therapy. Set out on an species / organ systems and disease basis which makes it easy to use and apply. Heavy Australian emphasis which is not always appropriate for this country - possums are unlikely to get antibiotics in NZ!</p>
			<p class="footerSG">Human Pharmacology Books</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">These are useful for a basic understanding of pharmacology, but do not cover all you need to know.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Goodman and Gilman: The pharmacological basis of therapeutics 11th ed (2005)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">This gives very comprehensive information about drugs, from chemical and pharmaceutical information right through mechanism of action to clinical human toxicity. It also provides a comprehensive review of physiology for each mechanism of drug action and is therefore also a very good physiology text. This book is expensive, but would be a valuable investment for anyone with an interest in physiology or pharmacology.</p>
			<p class="ParBodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Rang, Dale, Ritter and Moore: Pharmacology 5th ed (2003)</span></p>
			<p class="ParBodytext">A very easy to read book with excellent clear diagrams. Probably the best book for a clear explanation of mechanisms of action of the drugs covered. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">The best value for money.</span></p>

<p>The <strong>British National Formulary</strong> is a good (and cheap) source 
  of information on human drugs. Nearly all the human drugs available here are 
  available in the UK (although the reverse is not true). Format the same as the 
  Veterinary Formulary. The BNF is also <a href="http://bnf.vhn.net/home/">free 
  on the web</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Monthly Index of Medical Specialities</strong> is the human version of the IVS, 
  and contains basic information on most human drugs available in NZ. It is very 
  expensive to buy, but is a useful reference in practice. <a href="http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/index.asp">Medsafe</a> 
  (Ministry of Health) have most of the <a href="http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/DatasheetPage.htm">datasheets 
  </a>of human drugs available on their website.</p>
<p><strong>Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoeia</strong> is an excellent reference 
  on human drugs and has some veterinary information, but is too expensive to 
  buy. </p>
<p class="footerSG">Other books</p>
<p>Much information on veterinary therapy can be gleaned from medicine texts, 
  such as Ettinger's 'Textbook of veterinary internal medicine'; Blood Henderson 
  and Radostits 'Veterinary Medicine'; Lorenz and Cornelius's 'Small animal Medical 
  Diagnosis'; and the Merck Veterinary Manual.<br>
  The Merck Index (not to be confused with the human or veterinary Merck Manual) 
  is a good source of chemical information and references for drugs.<br>
  Some drug doses are given for reference but you are not expected to know them 
  at this stage. References for doses: IVS annual, Bishop &quot;The Veterinary 
  Formulary&quot;, Plumb &quot;Veterinary Drug Handbook&quot;</p>
