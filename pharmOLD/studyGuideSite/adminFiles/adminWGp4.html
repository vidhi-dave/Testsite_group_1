<p class="titleSG">Work Groups</p>
<p>The class will be asked to divide itself into groups of four. During the year, 
  the material presented in formal lectures should be revised through group discussion 
  of cases included in the notes at the end of each section. The primary purpose 
  of these working groups is to help you develop problem solving, reference searching 
  and decision-making skills necessary for competent therapeutics. The working 
  groups will also help you to learn the course material, and give you a sense 
  of the priorities to attach to different portions of the curriculum.</p>
<p>The groups will also be expected to research and write a dissertation. The 
  aims of this exercise are to:<br>
  &#8226;provide the intellectual stimulus of pursuing a topic in depth.<br>
  &#8226;familiarise you with sources of information about drugs; the use of library 
  and electronic information facilities.<br>
  &#8226;introduce you to various subjects which, whilst of interest to veterinary 
  graduates, are not necessarily covered in the course.<br>
  &#8226;give practice in assessing, sorting and summarising a bulk of complex 
  information from a variety of sources, and deriving clinically useful information 
  from it.<br>
  The dissertation will build on the skills you used last year in your review 
  of papers. You will have to go through a similar process but do not need to 
  write it all down. In the disseration, you only need to include your conclusions 
  after looking at the evidence, for instance, &quot;Smith (1989) compared drug 
  x and drug y, but inadequate controls and a small number of animals mean that 
  no firm conclusions can be drawn from this work.&quot;. </p>
<p>This sort of review is the basis of &#8220;evidence based medicine&#8221; which 
  is making inroads into preconceptions in human medicine but has not touched 
  veterinary medicine yet. &#8220;Evidence&#8221; comes in different forms:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. <strong>Randomised controlled trial</strong> - practically non existant 
    in veterinary medicine.<br>
    2. <strong>Non-randomised controlled trial</strong> - commoner.<br>
    3. <strong>Cohort / case controlled studies</strong> - rare<br>
    4. <strong>Case series</strong> - common, though single cases are commoner.<br>
    5. <strong>Expert opinion</strong> - commonest in veterinary medicine. Most 
    of this study guide is composed of expert (ie, my) opinion.<br>
    6. <strong>Traditional practice</strong>. Remarkably resilient even in the 
    face of evidence that it is harmful.<br>
    7. <strong>Sheer myth</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drug company advertising can fall into any of these categories.</p>
<p>You have to be able to give appropriate weight to different pieces of evidence 
  and be able to apply it to real situations. You may be surprised at how little 
  evidence there is to support widely used treatments.</p>
<p>Dissertations should be written as a short review paper and consist of (i) 
  Summary, (ii) Introduction, (iii) Main Discussion, (iv) Conclusions, (v) References. 
</p>
<p class="titleSG">Some handy hints on writing your dissertation</p>
<p class="footerSG">Choosing a subject</p>
<p>This is worth some thought. Ideally it should be a subject about which there 
  are both scientific and clinical papers published. Choose a narrow topic and 
  examine it in depth rather than taking a superficial look at a broad subject, 
  but on the other hand do not choose a subject that is so esoteric that only 
  one paper has been published about it! You will be expected to include all the 
  relevant papers on the subject in your review. <br>
  Try to avoid vaccines and immunology, as they come under Microbiology rather 
  than Pharmacology. You do not have to confine yourself to purely veterinary 
  pharmacology; anything from basic science to human use of drugs can be considered.<br>
  You may get ideas from cases you have seen in practice, or from personal experience. 
  We will attempt to guide you but the choice of subject is yours. One approach 
  is to compare a new or experimental treatment with an established treatment 
  for a specific condition, another approach is to look at all aspects of a new 
  drug and suggest possible uses in veterinary practice.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Title</p>
<p>This should be concise but convey as much information as possible, including 
  the species where appropriate.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Introduction</p>
<p>(1page of A4 maximum)<br>
  This should contain a concise statement of the problem. The objective of treatment 
  should be clearly defined. If you are examining a new drug then it should be 
  compared with something, usually conventional treatment. This should be briefly 
  described, including any problems encountered. You should say a bit about the 
  new drug and why it might be better than conventional treatment. This should 
  all form a coherent story leading up to the main discussion.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Main discussion</p>
<p>This is where you should examine the evidence in detail. If you are looking 
  at a new drug you should describe its mechanism of action. You should be able 
  to predict its therapeutic and side effects from this, even if they are not 
  reported.<br>
  Next look at clinical trials. In veterinary pharmacology, these are usually 
  appallingly badly done. Apply the same sort of analysis as you did for the 3rd 
  year disseration. You do need to write all this down : just say what you thought 
  the papers showed. Make sure you search the literature for all the relevant 
  papers!</p>
<p class="footerSG">Conclusions</p>
<p>These should be your conclusions drawn from an examination of the evidence. 
  They may not necessarily be the same conclusions as the authors of some of the 
  papers. You should be able to defend your conclusions if asked about them.</p>
<p class="footerSG">References</p>
<p>These should be cited in the text by number e.g. &#8220;dichlorvos depresses 
  cholinesterase by 40% (Jones and Smith 1980)&#8221; and listed at the end as 
  follows: <br>
  Jones &amp; Smith (1980). The effect of warblecides on cholinesterase levels 
  in cattle. Veterinary Record, 107, 114-118.<br>
  If you cannot find any better reference than this study guide, you have not 
  been searching hard enough!<br>
  The purpose of references is to allow the reader to look up the original work: 
  if they are not written in such a way as to allow this then they are merely 
  a waste of paper.</p>
<p class="footerSG">Presentation</p>
<p>The dissertation should be prepared on a word processor. This makes it easier 
  for us to read and makes it more valuable as a revision aid for you. Dissertations 
  should not exceed 4,000 words in length (excluding references). Try to be concise. 
  The dissertations should be written on A4 paper. They should conform to the 
  style required for the <a href="http://www.vetjournal.org.nz/pub.html">New Zealand 
  Veterinary Journal.</a></p>
<p>During your research for the disseration, you will have read your way through 
  a lot of turgid crap. Try not to add to this. Follow the rules of style written 
  by George Orwell many years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you 
    are used to seeing in print.<br>
    &#8226; Never use a long word where a short one will do.<br>
    &#8226; If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out.<br>
    &#8226; Never use the passive where you can use the active sense.<br>
    &#8226; Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if 
    you can think of an everyday English equivalent.<br>
    &#8226; Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footerSG">Organisation</p>
<p>You will work in teams of three or four and submit a single dissertation for 
  the team. Marks will be allocated on the assumption that each member of the 
  team has contributed equally to the dissertation; it is up to the team to ensure 
  equitable distribution of the work.<br>
  In order to allow the rest of the class to benefit from your work, each team 
  will be expected to present a poster of their work and be available to answer 
  questions about it. Posters should consist of pages of A4 paper; one each for 
  the title and authors, introduction, conclusions and main references, and two 
  for the main discussion. The writing should be large enough to be read easily 
  from a distance (at least 18 point). Do not go overboard with these posters, 
  they should involve a minimum of extra work.<br>
  The dissertation should be handed in by 29th May. This should give us time to 
  mark them and hand them back before the exams. This does not mean that you do 
  not have to do any work on it until the end of May - get started as soon as 
  you can. Come and talk to me as soon as you have any ideas about what you want 
  to to so that I can point you in the right direction.<br>
  The poster presentation will be in the foyer instead of the lecture on 27th 
  May (but watch the web site or notice board for changes). At least one person 
  from each group will be expected to man their poster to answer questions about 
  it.</p>
<p class="footer">The essay should be written on a word processor and handed in 
  or emailed to Paul Chambers by Friday 26th September.</p>
<p>This essay counts for 20% of your <a href="adminAss4.html">marks</a>. It will 
  be assumed that everyone has contributed equally - it is up to you to ensure 
  that this happens.</p>
