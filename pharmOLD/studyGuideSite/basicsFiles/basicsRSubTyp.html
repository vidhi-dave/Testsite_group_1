<p class="titleSG">Receptor sub-types</p>
<p align="left">Most receptors can produce slightly different effects or bind drugs with slightly different affinity in different species and different tissues (beware of rat papers). These differences are often assigned to subgroups of receptors which are then given different numbers (by different people). Sometimes there is no agreement on whether these subtypes really exist or are just experimental artefacts. For instance; adrenergic receptors are commonly divided into ? and ? receptors, since these are completely different types of receptors, but both are activated by adrenaline. They can be subdivided into ?1 ?2 ?1 and ?2 receptors. These can be further subdivided, eg ?2A ?2B ?2C ?2D etc. However, ?2A receptors in humans are identical to ?2D receptors in the rat, and there are several more ?2 receptors which have been cloned and have slightly different amino acid sequences (but no names as yet). You are only expected to know about the subtypes which are clinically important, so please do not get confused!</p>
		<p align="left">Receptor subtypes are not just a pharmacological fad: if subtype specific drugs can be developed, it may be possible to produce drugs with specific effects, ie no side effects. <a href="../cardioFiles/cardSymp.html">Adrenaline</a>, which acts at all adrenergic receptors, is not much use as a sedative because of its cardiovascular side effects, whereas <a href="../CNSfiles/CNSseda2.html">medetomidine</a>, a reasonably specific ?2A agonist, is a clinically useful sedative.</p>
		<p align="left">Traditionally, receptors have been characterised by studying the effects of drugs which are thought to act at those receptors. Increasingly, receptors are found by isolating and sequencing proteins at random, those with a similar sequence to known receptors are also assumed to be receptors. They are then put into or knocked out of transgenic mice to see what they do. This often produces surprising results which are difficult to interpret, but the art is still in its infancy.</p>
