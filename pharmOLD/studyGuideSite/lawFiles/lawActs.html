			<p class="titleSG">Acts of Parliament</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Animal Remedies Act (1967)</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Defined an animal remedy, made it illegal to sell an unregistered animal remedy, established the Animal Remedies Board which had control of drug registration and use. Drugs had to be safe and effective to be registered, and the ARB could refuse registration or impose conditions on use to take into account public health and environmental issues.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Most vets assume that the ACVM Act must be similar, but it is not.</p>
		<p class="subhead3">Classification of Animal Remedies</p>
		<p class="Bodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Class I prescription animal remedy</span> (PAR): may be administered to an animal only by a</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="Bodytext">veterinary surgeon
			<li class="Bodytext">under and in accordance with authority or prescription of veterinary surgeon.
		</ul>
		<p class="Bodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Class II PAR</span>: administered only by a</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="Bodytext">veterinary surgeon or
			<li class="Bodytext">in the presence and under the direct control of a veterinary surgeon.
		</ul>
		<p class="Bodytext"><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Class III PAR</span>: administered only by a veterinary surgeon</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">(Pethidine, carfentanil and fentanyl containing preparations are the only drugs in this category.)</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Other drugs can be purchased without a prescription, sometimes called over the counter drugs (OTC).</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">This classification will be continued under the ACVM Act. The term &ldquo;prescription animal remedy&rdquo; will be retained since the ACVM Act defines the more sensible term &ldquo;veterinary medicine&rdquo; in such a silly way.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Note that the Animal Remedies Act covered all aspects of veterinary medicines (including public health and environmental issues) in contrast to the ACVM Act.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act (1997)</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">&ldquo;Veterinary Medicine&rdquo; is defined as anything used in the direct management of animals, and this wide definition has caused problems. NZFSA have gradually reduced the working definition to something sensible. Tractors and sheds are now excluded (although the position of stockmen is unclear), and the idea of registering hypodermic needles and surgical instruments has been dropped. Grass is a veterinary medicine, although it is generally recognised as safe (GRAS in MAFspeak). To get round this problem, MAF are again referring to what the rest of the world knows as &ldquo;veterinary medicines&rdquo; as &ldquo;animal remedies&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">The ACVM Act is designed to manage specific risks: <span style="font-weight: bold; ">trade in primary produce</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; ">agricultural security</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; ">animal welfare</span>. Domestic food standards are mentioned as an afterthought. Benefits such as efficacy are not considered (you are supposed to sue the manufacturer under consumer legislation if the drug does not work) and safety is only considered as it affects animal welfare. Inaccurate labelling (exaggerated claims) is also a matter for the Fair Trading Act (1986).</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Under the ACVM Act, the Animal Remedies Board (which controlled drug registration and use) has been abolished and drug registration is now subject to political control.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">It is illegal to use drugs in animals which are not registered with MAF or specifically exempted from registration (either with or without conditions). To comply with international treaties, it is likely that nearly all drugs for use in food animals will have to be registered (eg antibiotics). Registration can involve conditions on use. Drugs which pose a low risk will be exempted (eg hoof treatments, oxygen, shampoos, human over the counter medicines). Many drugs for small animals are fall into the &ldquo;exempted with conditions&rdquo; category, in most cases, the conditions will be that a code of practice is followed, although in some cases the conditions may be related to the manufacturing process, or packaging and labelling, and will not directly affect vets. The relevant code of practice for vets will usually be the <span style="font-weight: bold; ">NZVA Code of Practice for the Discretionary Use of Human and Veterinary Medicines by Registered Veterinarians</span> (more on this below).</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Horses will be treated as companion animals, provided a long withholding period (60 days) is observed.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">The PAR classification will persist but be modified. Nearly all antibiotics will be PAR1s and will be subdivided into six categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="Bodytext">Level 1 - no controls (not PAR)
			<li class="Bodytext">Level 2 - PAR1 but use for growth promotion banned (similar to current PAR1)
			<li class="Bodytext">Level 3 - PAR1 for serious infections when culture and sensitivity has shown nothing else is likely to work
			<li class="Bodytext">Level 4 - as level 3 but MAF must be notified of every use
			<li class="Bodytext">Level 5 - banned in food animals
			<li class="Bodytext">Level 6 - banned in <span style="font-weight: bold; ">all </span>animals
		</ul>
		<p class="Bodytext">This is a sensible system, providing drugs are put into the right classes. This system will be imposed as conditions on registration.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">There is also a silly proposal to make all PAR3s into PAR2s and allow vets to prescribe for animals over the phone or via the internet. Hopefully most vets will consider it unethical to prescribe for animals where they are not in a position to make a diagnosis or monitor the effects of treatment.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">The NZFSA is also attempting to separate prescribing from trading in veterinary medicines, which would allow anyone with a trader&apos;s licence to fill prescriptions written by a vet. The NZVA strenuously opposes this, and the outcome is unclear at the moment.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">One of the big problems with the ACVM Act is that since the Act itself contains so little useful information, the civil servants in the ACVM Group of the NZFSA have had to make up the rules as they go along. It can be very difficult to determine what is actual law and what is only ACVM Group policy.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">The NZVA have published their summary of the ACVM Act in their <a href="http://www.vets.org.nz/Vetzone/Forms/infoforms.htm">Guide to Veterinary Pharmacy and Dispensing</a>, which all vets should read: </p>
		<p class="Subhead2"><span class="footerSG">Agricultural Comounds and Veterinary Medicines Regs (2001)</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">These list the &ldquo;veterinary medicines&rdquo; which are exempt from registration under the ACVM Act (medicines made up for use on someone&apos;s own animals, medical gases, hoof and skin perparations, etc, etc), and specify the conditions for those which are exempt with conditions (homoeopathic preparations, herbal medicines, antiseptics, human medicines and medicines compounded by vets).</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">The regs also include a list of banned poisonous plants, and a list of substances generally recognised as safe. There are also specifications for labels.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">Coming soon</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">A list of banned drugs; mostly things like DDT and strychnine, which have not been used for years.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act (1996)</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">As the name suggests, this is designed to regulate hazardous substances (environmental and human effects) and new organisms (anything not already present in NZ). It established the Environmental Risk Management Agency (ERMA) which is currently bogged down in trying to regulate genetically engineered organisms. All veterinary medicines will have to be registered under this act too, but they do not appear to have thought much about the hazardous substances part yet (it has been amended three or four times so far). Even so, veterinary medicines are due to come under the Act by July 2004. The HSNO Act is different from other Acts by registering generic substances: thus if a company spends megabucks registering their new drug, other companies can freeload on this registration once the patent runs out. Understandably, this does not encourage registration. A sensible compromise has emerged, where ERMA delegates registration of low risk compounds to more appropriate people, such as the ACVM Group of the NZFSA.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">A possible unpleasant scenario is that vets might have to apply for &quot;approved handler&quot; licences, possibly even have a licence for each class of drugs.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">ERMA regards drugs with potential environmental effects, such as avermectins, as high risk. It is not out of the question that drenches will have the same restrictions as nuclear waste!</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Masochists should consult the <a href="http://www.ermanz.govt.nz/hs/transfer-veterinary-medicines.asp">ERMA website</a>.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">This Act has the potential to cause complete chaos; if it was enforced as it is, all industry in NZ would stop.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Medicines Act (1981)</p>
		<p class="Subhead2"><span class="footerSG">Medicines Regulations (1984/143)</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Regulates the manufacture, supply and use of human medicines. Drugs must be approved for sale, and must meet standards for purity, safety and efficacy. Covers prescriptions, labelling and storage requirements (see below). Veterinary surgeons may prescribe and dispense drugs <span style="font-weight: bold; ">for animals under their care</span>. Classifies drugs into &ldquo;Prescription only medicines&rdquo;, &ldquo;Restricted medicines&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pharmacy medicines&rdquo;, which are subject to different controls. Drugs not specifically classified are &ldquo;general sales medicines&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Administered by Medsafe, who have an excellent <a href="http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs.htm">web site</a>.</p>
		<p class="footerSG">Misuse of Drugs Act (1975)</p>
		<p class="Subhead2"><span class="footerSG"><span style="font-stretch: Normal; ">Misuse of Drugs Regulations (1977/37)</span></span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Summary</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">The main legislation designed to control the use of addictive drugs. Classifies controlled drugs - mainly important for illegal possession. Vets are permitted to supply, prescribe and administer controlled drugs Class B or C for animals under their care. Specifies the more stringent requirements for prescriptions, labelling and storage of controlled drugs. Allows the Minister of Health to ban specific vets from prescribing controlled drugs, ensures that the Veterinary Council is informed of any convictions concerning controlled drugs so that convicts can be struck off.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">Class A controlled drugs</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Drugs of addiction such as LSD, heroin, cocaine, most amphetamines; drugs with no clinical use such as thalidomide (and Spanish fly!). The only drug of veterinary interest is etorphine. It is probably included here as it is highly dangerous to people. Permission from the Minister of Health is required to use Class A drugs. You should not come across these drugs in practice in NZ.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">Class B controlled drugs:</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Most opioids, including diphenoxylate (but also ecstasy and cannabis for some reason). In veterinary practice it is never necessary to prescribe or dispense Class B drugs: they should be kept in the clinic and administered to the animal as needed.</p>
		<p class="subhead3"><span class="footerSG">Class C controlled drugs</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Codeine, barbiturates, buprenorphine, meprobamate; very dilute solutions of morphine, &lt; 2.5mg diphenoxylate (also cannabis plant and coco leaf!) Benzodiazepines, which are the class of drugs most widely abused by people, have recently been added to class C. &ldquo;Designer drugs&rdquo; (analogues of drugs of abuse) are in class C 7. This includes carfentanil (!?).Some drugs commonly used in small animal practice such as pseudoephedrine (used illegally to make methamphetamine) are likely to be made class C soon.</p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Ketamine is a controlled drug in most countries, but is treated very casually in NZ. This situation is unlikely to last.</p>
		<p class="Subhead2"><span class="footerSG">Security</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Controlled Drugs from classes B and C 1 - 4 and 7 must be secured when not in use. Secured means locked in a metal or concrete cabinet bolted down to the building and keys kept elsewhere. These drugs should not be left unattended in vehicles. Remember that pentobarbitone is class C 4. Class C 5 do not need to be locked up, but it is still a good idea.</p>
		<p class="Subhead2"><span class="footerSG">Records</span></p>
		<p class="Bodytext">Class B drugs must have records kept of their use. A Controlled Drugs Register must be kept on the premises (usually with the drugs). It must be a bound book with consecutively numbered pages with details of one form of one drug per page. Entries must be legible and indelible, and filled in within 24 hours of the use of the drug. A full audit of drugs obtained and used is to be carried out at the end of June and December. The Controlled Drug Register must be available for inspection by the police or Ministry of Health officers.</p>
