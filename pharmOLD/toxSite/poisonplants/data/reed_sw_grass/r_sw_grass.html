      <p class="header">Description</p>
      <p>An aquatic, reed
like perennial, growing up to 2.5 metres in height. It has broad, bright green leaves up to 20mm across and ranging from 20 to 60mm in length. A noticeable brown mark is present where the leaf meets the sheath, and it has a blunt, or abruptly pointed ligule. Habitat:</p>
      <p class="header">Similar plants</p>
      <p class="header">Distribution</p>
      <p>Restrictedmostly to Otago and Southland in NZ. The plant is located 
        mostly in fresh or brackish water especially at the edge of marshes, and 
        can survive in water up to 80cm in depth.</p>
      <p class="header">Toxin</p>
      <p>Has been recommended as a nutritional fodder plant for livestock grazing 
        wet areas, and consequently its introduction to NZ was not discouraged. 
        However there are several sporadic accounts of poisoning of cattle by 
        this plant. The toxic agent within Glyceria maxima is cyanide, which acts 
        by blocking cytochrome oxidases, preventingcellular respiration.Poisoning: 
        The majority of cases of G. maxima poisoning have occurred between September 
        and November, coinciding with the period of maximal growth by the plant. 
        Rapidly growing vegetative tillers contain the highest concentrations 
        of cyanide within the plant, while flowering culms have mild levels, and 
        seed heads have not been shown to contain any of the poison. However, 
        overall cyanide levels within the plant peak largely in the spring, with 
        a smaller, second rise in the autumn. </p>
      <p class="header">Species affected</p>
      <p>Hungry cattle.</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 acute</p>
      <p class="body"> typical of cyanide poisoning. These include restlessness, 
        convulsions, dyspnoea, as well as depression. However, these are only 
        noted early in a case of toxicity, and usually the first sign of poisoning 
        that is noted is sudden death of affected animals.</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 chronic</p>
      <p class="header">Post mortem signs</p>
      <p class="body">Presence of the plant in the ruminal contents. Also a reddening 
        and inflammation of the rumen and abomasal wall has been recorded.</p>
      <p class="header">Diagnosis</p>
      <p class="body">Clinical signs, post mortem findings, as well as the animal 
        having grazed with access to the plant.</p>
      <p class="header">Differential diagnosis</p>
      <p class="body">Ingestion of other sources of cyanide. This includes plants 
        such as sorghum grasses, or artificial sources, for example misplaced 
        possum bait. Another possible differential is &quot;grain overload syndrome&quot; 
        or rumen acidosis. This could be ruled out as a differential by examination 
        of the rumen contents, as well as investigating the recent grazing history 
        of the cattle (supplemental feeding? Grazed near a source of G. maxima?). 
      </p>
      <p class="header">Treatment</p>
      <p class="body">Sodium nitrate can be given at 10 
 20 mg/kg IV, and sodium thiosulphate can also be given at a dose rate of 500 mg/kg IV.</p>
      <p class="header">Prognosis</p>
      <p class="body"> Very poor. Usually they are not even detected as showing 
        any clinical signs before death. </p>
