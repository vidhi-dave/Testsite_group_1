      <p class="Latinname">Allium cepa</p>
      <p class="header">Other names</p>
      <p class="header">Description</p>
      <p>Biennial with smooth, hollow leaves which are grey
green, narrow, slightly indented on one side, and smell of onion when crushed. Height to 30 cm, although may reach 1 m, depending on the variety and the climate. The erect, hollow stems are topped by small white flowers packed together in a dense spherical shape. The bulb is covered in brown skin, with concentric layers of white flesh, with a firm, circular base producing a cluster of fine, straight roots.</p>
      <p class="header">Similar plants</p>
      <p class="body">Many <em>Allium</em> species are grown in gardens, including 
        garlic, leeks, chives, etc: three cornered garlic (<em>A. triquetrum</em>) 
        is locally abundant in damp, shady places and may be eaten by stock.</p>
      <p class="header">Distribution</p>
      <p>Vegetable gardens, commonly grown vegetable. Cultivated on a field scale 
        in some places. Also found growing wild in pasture or along riverbanks 
        and in parks. Considerable quantities of onions are either discarded in 
        disposal areas or deliberately fed to livestock and have caused poisoning. 
      </p>
      <p class="header">Toxin</p>
      <p>Onions contain propyl disulphide, 1-propenyl disulphide and 2-propenyl disulphide, all of which are chemically similar to S-methyl-L cysteine sulphoxide (SMCO), the anaemia inducing agent present in <a href="../cabbage/cabbage.html">Brassica</a> plants. A variety of related toxins are also present in differing quantities in the various species of <em>Allium</em>. They alter the enzyme glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase in the metabolic chain within the erythrocytes, leading to denaturation and precipitation of haemoglobin, which in turn results in the formation of Heinz bodies. Those erythrocytes with are removed by the reticulo endothelial system. If enough are removed, a haemolytic anaemia will develop. n propyldisulphide has been shown to have a goitrogenic effect in experimental animals.</p>
      <p class="header">Species affected</p>
      <p>Cattle are the most susceptible domestic animal, dogs, and horses are intermediate and sheep and goats are least affected. Cats can be affected similarly to, but less severely than, dogs. It would appear that younger animals are more able to withstand the toxic effects of onions. People, pigs and poultry have also been poisoned. Cooking does not affect toxicity, but may make onions more palatable. A dairy cow has been poisoned by 7kg of onions per day.</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 acute</p>
      <p class="body">Clinical signs range from acute to chronic. Haemoglobinuria, anaemia and icterus are constant signs of this poisoning, and most cases are characterised by a strong onion odour on the breath, excrement, milk and flesh. Diarrhoea, loss of appetite (however, in one study, animals retained their appetite until they became very anaemic), depression, cessation of rumination, defaecation and urination, subnormal body temperature, tachycardia, pale conjunctiva, blood stained urine, muscle tremors, paralysis, ataxia, collapse (especially following exercise), and sudden death have all been reported. The severity of the anaemia appears to be related to the proportion of onions in the diet, and may be worsened by concurrent haemologic stresses such as repeated blood sampling or heavy parasite burdens. Studies have shown no apparent effect on foetal development. Apparently healthy cattle may display clinical signs of onion toxicity up to 10 - 14 days after removal from onions.</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 chronic</p>
      <p class="header">Post mortem signs</p>
      <p class="body">Jaundice of mucous membranes, subcutaneous tissues and muscles, inflammation of the digestive tract, dark or blood
stained urine, dark, swollen kidneys and fatty degeneration of the liver, which is usually pale brown, swollen and necrotic. Tissues smell of onion and many pieces of onion may be present in the rumen/stomach. Histopathology will reveal haemosiderin in the liver and kidney.</p>
      <p class="header">Diagnosis</p>
      <p class="body">Clinical signs with or without history. Haematology (eg: 
        decreased haemoglobin and PCV, increased leucocyte number) including the 
        presence of Heinz bodies in erythrocytes. Resolution of clinical signs 
        following removal of onions from the diet may assist in a retrospective 
        diagnosis.</p>
      <p class="header">Differential diagnosis</p>
      <p class="body">Similar to that of toxicity induced by S
methylcysteine sulphoxide (a rare toxic amino acid in Brassica species) in livestock. Other toxicities, for example, heavy metals and prussic acid, may result in similar clinical signs. In one case, a puppy was originally misdiagnosed as having epilepsy with a possible heart condition.</p>
      <p class="header">Treatment</p>
      <p class="body"> Remove animals from source and prevent future access to 
        onions. Symptomatic and supportive care is beneficial, provided it can 
        be administered without excitement, as sudden death may occur with restraint. 
        Blood transfusion resulted in immediate improvement in one group of cattle.</p>
      <p class="header">Prognosis</p>
      <p class="body">Death can occur if left untreated. The anaemia is reversible 
        and is likely to resolve provided the animals are removed from the source.</p>
      <p class="header">Prevention</p>
      <p class="body">Do not feed onions to pets or livestock unless they have 
        been gradually introduced and have access to other feed.</p>
