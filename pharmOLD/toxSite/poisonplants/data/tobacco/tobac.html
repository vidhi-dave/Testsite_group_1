      <p class="Latinname">Nicotiana tabacum and N. sylvestris</p>
      <p class="header">Other names</p>
      <p class="header">Description</p>
      <p> <em>N. tabacum</em> and <em>N. sylvestris</em> are tall plants up to 2 m. The leaves are large, hairy, broad, thin and fragile, usually covered with a sticky secretion with an unpleasant smell. The trumpet shaped flowers are white or pink to red in colour. Many
seeded capsules may appear in late summer.</p>
      <p class="header">Similar plants</p>
      <p class="body"><em>N. sylvestris</em> is pictured, <em>N. tabacum</em> 
        (the tobacco of commerce) is very similar, but the flowers are not fragrant. 
        <em>N. alata</em> and the hybrid <em>N. x sanderae</em> are common in 
        gardens.</p>
      <p class="header">Distribution</p>
      <p>Commercial tobacco originated in South America. Perennial in Mexico, 
        it is cultivated as an annual in commercial growing areas. This plant 
        is not commonly found in New Zealand, except for garden escapes (although 
        it was once grown commercially in the Hutt Valley). Its large leaves, 
        rich in nicotine, are used, after drying, for making of cigars and cigarettes.</p>
      <p class="header">Toxin</p>
      <p>Nicotine, an alkaloid with an irritating effect on the stomach and intestines and also the nervous system. In a human unaccustomed to tobacco, 4 mg can cause clinical signs, and 60 mg at one time can cause death. Once absorbed, the alkaloids (nicotine), have a saponin
like haemolytic action on red blood cells and may produce transient haemoglobinuria. The compounds and their aglycones are extremely depressant to the central nervous system and have a cardiac glycoside &#150; like action on the heart, i.e. act as a positive ionotrope by increasing calcium concentration in myocardium.
        The leaves are the most toxic part of the plant. Tobacco remains toxic 
        when dried, therefore processed feeds containing tobacco are not safe 
        for consumption.All species of Nicotiana are poisonous, but there have 
        been no reported cases in NZ.</p>
      <p class="header">Species affected</p>
      <p>All animals may be affected, pets in contact with tobacco products are 
        at risk as are pigs allowed to forage on harvested tobacco fields. However, 
        the green plants taste unpleasant and pigs will not usually eat them. 
        Pets can easily be poisoned by tobacco products in the home, either accidentally 
        or maliciously.</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 acute</p>
      <p class="body">Clinical signs nearly always are present, but only rarely 
        is a lethal dose ingested. The initial signs of poisoning can develop 
        within 10 to 15 minutes or may not manifest for several hours. At first, 
        the irritating effect that tobacco has on the stomach and intestines will 
        cause salivating, vomiting (if capable), and diarrhoea. Shortly after 
        the digestive signs develop, neurologic signs appear. Initially, nicotine 
        stimulates the nervous system, with depression of the nervous system occurring 
        at a later time. Early signs include nervousness, shaking, trembling, 
        a stiff and uncoordinated gait, weakness and collapse. Cardiac abnormalities 
        may be noted as well as breathing difficulties, to the point of respiratory 
        paralysis (the cause of death in lethal cases).</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 chronic</p>
      <p class="body">Birth defects have been well documented when pregnant sows 
        ingest tobacco. The most common defects are limb deformities in the piglets.	
      </p>
      <p class="header">Post mortem signs</p>
      <p class="body">Hyperaemia of the alimentary tract, often with severe haemorrhage, 
        together with a generalized congestion of the visceral organs.</p>
      <p class="header">Diagnosis</p>
      <p>Clinical signs, history and on stomach contents.</p>
      <p class="header">Differential diagnosis</p>
      <p class="body">G.I. irritation alone include:
 many toxins. Neurological signs include:
 organophosphate poisoning (nicotine acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor), carbamate poisoning, blue
green algae poisoning and hemlock poisoning.</p>
      <p class="header">Treatment</p>
      <p class="body">symptomatic. This includes gastric lavage, activated charcoal, electrolytes, fluids and anti
convulsants. Pilocarpine, physostigmine, or GI protectants may be indicated.</p>
      <p class="header">Prognosis</p>
      <p class="body">Prognosis is good, provided the animal is decontaminated 
        by either pumping the stomach or administering activated charcoal etc. 
        However, if the animal has ingested a high dose and is not decontaminated, 
        then death through respiratory and cardiac depression is probable.</p>
      <p class="header">Prevention</p>
      <p class="body">Do not allow pets to be in contact with tobacco or tobacco 
        products. Do not let animals drink from ash trays, since this water can 
        have extremely high concentrations of nicotine. In sows, there is disagreement 
        over whether a &quot;danger window&quot; for consumption of tobacco during 
        gestation exists (there are two possibilities, that on days 10 to 30 of 
        gestation the piglets are susceptible, or that anything after 30 days 
        is dangerous). Do not let pregnant sows graze on tobacco.</p>
