      <p class="header">Description</p>
      <p>A 10
30 cm long plant in the family Primulaceae, <em>A. arvensis</em> is a prostrate to suberect annual herb with branching four
angled stems, slender roots and scattered glandular hairs. Leaves up to 20 mm long, bright green, opposite, stalkless and are oval but pointed at the tip. Flowers brick red or pink, rarely blue, carried on slender stalks, 10
15mm across and usually have a star
like appearance due to the presence of five minutely toothed lobes. They appear mid to late summer, closing at night and on cloudy days. Fruit brown, three
angled capsule, about 5 mm diameter, which opens by means of transverse slits.</p>
      <p class="header">Similar plants</p>
      <p class="body">Chickweed has similar leaves, but small white flowers. Not 
        toxic (in fact, nutritious). <a href="../creeping_mallow/cr_mallo.html">Creeping 
        mallow</a> has similar flowers.</p>
      <p class="header">Distribution</p>
      <p>Scarlet pimpernel is a native of Britain that is now found as a weed 
        in most countries. It is common in cultivated land in both the North and 
        South Islands, as well as in gardens, wasteland and roadsides.</p>
      <p class="header">Toxin</p>
      <p>A glycosidal saponin has been isolated from the aerial parts of the plant 
        and a saponin (cyclamin) from the roots. An acrid volatile oil has also 
        been isolated. By causing gastrointestinal irritation, saponin increases 
        systemic absorption and severe toxicity. The renal tubules are specifically 
        destroyed by the plant toxin, without a significant affect on other organs 
        occurring. All parts are said to be toxic and to have a narcotic affect, 
        but the plant is reputedly unpalatable. However, studies suggest that 
        the palatability and toxicity increases after extraordinarily heavy rains 
        in summer, due to exuberant growth of the plant. Although the exact conditions 
        under which this plant is nephrotoxic for stock have yet to be defined, 
        it should still be regarded as a potential source of toxicity.</p>
      <p class="header">Species affected</p>
      <p>Sheep, cattle, horses, mules, dogs, rabbits and birds. Conflicting reports 
        exist as to whether it is toxic to poultry. Humans can suffer dermatitis 
        as a result of contact with the leaves. Has been recorded poisoning of 
        sheep, cattle and horses in Australia and suspected poisoning of sheep 
        in New Zealand.</p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 acute</p>
      <p class="body">Scarlet pimpernel consistently causes intestinal irritation 
        and effects on the nervous system. Affected animals have a slow, stiff, 
        staggering gait, are weak and listless and both appetite and rumination 
        are suppressed. Constipation, followed by blood stained diarrhoea and 
        dark coloured froth in the urine may also occur as may dyspnoea and a 
        weak pulse. Blood changes are not seen until 24 hours before death (at 
        which time clinical signs of illness are evident) but may include high 
        blood urea nitrogen and plasma magnesium levels, and lowered plasma calcium 
        levels. A rapid drop in temperature also occurs at the terminal stage, 
        remaining within normal limits before this. </p>
      <p class="header">Clinical signs 
 chronic</p>
      <p class="header">Post mortem signs</p>
      <p>Coagulative necrosis and renal cortical intratubular haemorrhage are 
        the most conspicuous lesions seen. Widespread oedema is seen, namely in 
        the subcutaneous tissue (especially along the ventral abdominal wall), 
        submucosa of the abomasum, mesentery, lungs, and is especially severe 
        perirenally. Congestion of mucous membranes, liver, lungs, kidneys and 
        stomach is also apparent and the kidneys appear pale tan, and swollen 
        with severe nephrosis being indicated by numerous disseminated petechial 
        haemorrhages within the cortex. Petechial and ecchymotic haemorrhages 
        may also appear in the subcutis and beneath the epicardium. Histopathology 
        reveals evidence of a severe toxic nephrosis. Glomeruli appear relatively 
        unaffected but there is severe coagulative necrosis of the proximal convoluted 
        tubules, and relatively severe fatty change in the distal ones. The renal 
        medulla appears relatively unaffected. </p>
      <p class="header">Diagnosis</p>
      <p>History and clinical signs are suggestive, with post mortem examination 
        revealing the characteristic signs of a toxic nephrosis.</p>
      <p class="header">Differential diagnosis</p>
      <p class="body">Other Primulaceae; Cyclamen species. Cases which were later 
        confirmed as A. arvensis poisoning were originally diagnosed as oxalate 
        poisoning, mycotoxicoses and nephrosis of undetermined aetiology. Other 
        differentials include poisoning by mercurial salts, lead, copper, arsenic, 
        bismuth, cadmium, superphosphate fertilizer (due to sodium fluoride content). 
        Bacterial toxins, poisoning by Quercus species or drugs such as aminoglycosides, 
        tetracyclines, amphotericin B, monensin and sulphonamides should also 
        be considered.</p>
      <p class="header">Treatment</p>
      <p class="body"> Symptomatic and supportive. One report states that horses 
        and mules exhibited a slow, but complete, recovery when treated with vitamins, 
        iron and a change of straw.</p>
      <p class="header">Prognosis</p>
      <p>Variable depending on amount ingested. Coma and death usually occur 24 
 36 hours after the first signs appear, although it would seem that the plant is only this toxic after certain environmental conditions have occurred (ie unusually heavy rains in summer). How long it takes for fatal kidney damage to develop is dependent on the dose of toxic material ingested.</p>
