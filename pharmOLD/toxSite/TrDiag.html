						<p>&nbsp;The diagnosis of poisoning requires a wide range of clinical skills.&nbsp; When toxicosis occurs, there is often no clear evidence of exposure to a poison.&nbsp; Frequently the animals are just found dead, moribund or showing generalised clinical effects that could well be produced by a variety of problems.</p>
						<p>There are literally thousands of poisons of chemical and plant origin to which animals are at risk and in any given text it is only possible to deal with those which commonly occur and those which may be peculiar to a country or a region.</p>
						<p>It must also be remembered that the effect of poisons may be quite different between the species.&nbsp; The veterinary surgeon dealing with several grazing species of animals as well as monogastric species, has a very difficult task to be conversant with the extensive range of poisons affecting these animals.&nbsp; Therefore it is important that a clinical procedure is followed in all toxicological investigations, for not infrequently the veterinary surgeon is called to investigate a problem not experienced previously.</p>
						<p>Further as the range of herbicides, dips, drenches, and pesticides extends and changes, new toxicological situations arise which call for new knowledge in both diagnosis and therapy.&nbsp; Some previously common toxicological problems in NZ are now uncommon.&nbsp; For example, previously there were many cases of strychnine, cyanide, arsenic, organochlorine and paraquat poisoning. &nbsp;Some of these have been removed from sale (e.g. arsenical dips), while others such as cyanide have decreased in popularity as a possum poison. On the other hand because of the increased use of 1080 in possum baits, accidental poisoning from it has increased.</p>
						<p>While the basic clinical procedure in toxicological examinations is similar to other medical examinations, much more emphasis is placed on the ability of the clinician to fossic out from the environment just what was the poison to which the animal had access.</p>
						<p>Yet another complicating factor in most toxicoses is the urgency required in making a diagnosis and instigating some form of therapy.&nbsp; In brief you are dealing with an emergency and frequently, further animals are at risk if effective action is not taken by the veterinary surgeon and the owner.</p>
						<p>As either a veterinary student or a new and inexperienced veterinary surgeon it is vital to follow a regular pattern of investigation so that with experience one becomes thoroughly competent with the special clinical procedure required for toxicological problems.&nbsp; If this is done the veterinarian will find that toxicology is a most rewarding and exciting branch of veterinary science.</p>

					<p>The diagnosis of poisoning rests on five components, some of which may be more important than others.&nbsp; A diagnosis may be made from the proper use of only one or two of these components, but it is important to realise that each is an additional back up to your final diagnosis.&nbsp; Remember also that not infrequently, veterinarians become involved in litigation, so that the more evidence recorded the sounder is your diagnosis and course of action.</p>
					<p>The five components of a definitive diagnosis are:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Consideration of <a href="#cirEv">circumstantial evidence</a>.
							
						<li><a href="#clinEv">Clinical signs</a> shown not only in the individual but also other members of the herd or flock as a whole must be considered.
							
						<li><a href="#pm">Post mortem</a> examination of dead animals and a careful pathological investigation.
							
						<li>Clinical pathology tests and <a href="#pm">chemical analysis</a> of tissues from either dead or living animals, for traces of suspected poisons.

 requires ethical committee approval so never carried out in practice, and avoided elswhere whenever possible.</div>

					</table>
					<p>This can be a very broad area of investigation and means the animal's environment must be meticulously examined, both by investigation and careful questioning of the client.&nbsp; Toxicology hazards of the environment may be either naturally occurring or man
made.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Naturally
occurring hazards</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Poisonous minerals 
 Most problems associated with minerals are local in nature: for example the selenaceous soils of America, and some regions of both Australia and NZ where high copper levels of soil and pasture are seen.&nbsp; Similarly fluorine contaminated waters are a well
recognised hazard in different parts of the world.<li><a href="poisonplants/index.html">Poisonous plants</a> 
 These represent a highly specialised toxicological hazard.&nbsp; The veterinarian has a responsibility to be conversant with, and able to recognise local plants and pastures which may be toxic to grazing animals.&nbsp; Again many of these problems are local in nature and are either associated with the plant directly or fungi which infest them at particular times of the year e.g. facial eczema and ryegrass staggers.</ul>
					<p class="sgH3">Man
made hazards</p>
					</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Industrial contamination 
 Where agriculture and industry are closely associated, contamination of water and herbage by industrial effluents is always likely.&nbsp; Contamination can take place either through atmospheric transfer or where bulk waste is dumped on unused land.&nbsp; In the latter situation flooding may cause leaching and transfer of the waste to surrounding areas.&nbsp; Many examples of industrial contamination and the poisoning of both human and animals can be given. Materials frequently associated with industrial contamination include, lead, arsenic, fluorine, chromium, phenols, cyanide, alcohol and waste oil.<li>Herbicides and pesticides 
<b> </b>The products included under this heading are numerous.&nbsp; For example the widespread use of the organophosphates for controlling pests of both plants and animals has produced a range of toxicological problems with domestic animals.&nbsp; Further as these products are changed and improved still further toxicoses may arise.&nbsp; A knowledge of all herbicides and pesticides is not possible for the individual so that reference centres must be used. In spite of warnings on these products there are still many cases of poisoning recorded in New Zealand each year from weed killers, rodenticides, orchard sprays, dips and molluscicides.
									
						<li>Domestic Materials 
<b> </b>Domestic materials still account for many cases of individual poisoning, particularly among pet animals.&nbsp; High on the list of frequency is still lead poisoning occurring from paint flakes in particular.&nbsp; Other domestic materials that present a serious risk include sump oil, diesel oil, detergents, antifreeze (ethylene glycol) and salted foods.
									
						<li>Drugs 
<b> </b>Poisoning of animals with drugs may occur from using human medication for animals e.g. cats given aspirin or from veterinary therapy using an inappropriate dose schedule. The incorrect use of drugs by a veterinarian is referred to as iatrogenesis. In the use of drugs, a whole range of individual matters must be considered, including species differences, the vulnerability of the very young and old, and a wider range of factors associated with the animal's ability to biotransform and excrete the particular chemical.
									
						<li>Food &amp; Water 
 There are many examples of poisoning from food and water.&nbsp; Food may be badly harvested and stored as in dicoumarol poisoning with spoiled sweet clover, solanine poisoning from green potatoes, mouldy hay toxicoses, or nitrate poisoning from steeped mangolds.&nbsp; Severe contamination of stored food can also occur.&nbsp; A good example recorded in New Zealand was hyperkeratosis of cattle associated with the feeding of hay which had been stored in a hayshed where chlorinated naphthalenes had been used as a wood preservative. Then there was the serious loss of human lives and livestock and poultry in North America following cattle food contamination with PBB (polybrominated biphenyl, a fire retardant).</div></div>

					</table>
					<p>While many signs are suggestive of poisoning, few are pathognomonic.&nbsp; Many can be duplicated by several poisons.&nbsp; The range of clinical signs for any poisoning is limited, however, a variety of clinical signs are seen for any poisoning due to differences between individuals and animal species.&nbsp; Some of these differences can be accounted for by anatomical and physiological differences, e.g. bracken contains a thiaminase which destroys the essential Vitamin B for the horse and rat but ruminants have microbes which synthesize their own Vitamin B and so don't require an exogenous source of the vitamin.</p>
					<p>The course of the poisoning may be either acute or chronic.&nbsp; Acute poisoning is characterised by intense clinical symptoms, with a rapid course, often terminating with the animal's death.&nbsp; Chronic poisoning results from repeated exposure to low doses, or ingestion of a single dose of poison which is eliminated slowly from the body.</p>
					<p>Debilitated animals are more susceptible to the action of poisons and drugs because their general resistance to adverse conditions is low, and the mechanisms which assist in the detoxification and elimination of substances foreign to the body may be defective.&nbsp; Certain toxins do consistently affect specific systems of the body.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Nervous System</p>
					<p>Toxicant induced seizures are usually generalised, bilaterally symmetrical and without local onset.&nbsp; The initiating cause of the seizures can seldom be determined by the type of the seizure alone.&nbsp; A toxin which produces signs of excitement, is prognostically more favourable, than when paralytic symptoms are the result.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Alimentary System</p>
					<p>Anatomical differences of the alimentary tract between species is very important in determining the course of the toxicity.&nbsp; Carnivores have a short, efficient digestive tract compared to herbivorous animals.&nbsp; Absorption from the alimentary tract of the dog is rapid and complete, so that a small amount of poison is likely to produce clinical signs.&nbsp; In ruminants, ingested poisons are diluted in the rumen and the ruminal microbes actively destroy some vegetable toxins.&nbsp; Malnutrition, parasitism and stress are important in lowering the resistance of the animal to poisons.&nbsp; The nature and quantity of feed ingested also influences the animal's response to gastrointestinal poisons.</p>
					<p>The alimentary tract signs of diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation often occur in conjunction with the dysfunction of other organ systems.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Liver</p>
					<p>The liver is the major organ of drug metabolism and excretion.&nbsp; It has large reserves so that death usually occurs before the liver function is fatally impaired.</p>
					<p>Liver function tests and clinical signs such as jaundice will not identify the toxic agent but will provide indirect information on the amount of damage caused to the liver.&nbsp; An animal exposed to a short
term or single hepatotoxic incident may regain full liver function if it survives the acute insult.&nbsp; The liver is usually swollen and oedematous following an acute chemical injury, conversely continued exposure to a hepatotoxin may result in fibrosis and cirrhosis, so that the liver becomes small and shrunken e.g. chronic facial eczema.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Kidney</p>
					<p>Acute nephrosis results in similar clinical signs regardless of the cause, although these clinical signs may be complicated or obscured by the effects of other systems.&nbsp; The renal effects of a toxic agent may be apparent within hours following exposure, or renal failure may occur days later.&nbsp; Once the damage has occurred, healing may take weeks.&nbsp; Therapy must be aimed at determining the extent of the damage and keeping the patient alive until recovery can occur.</p>
					<p>Urine examination may be helpful in detecting poisons and there are specific changes which may be seen (Table 1).</p>

					<p class="sgH3">Blood</p>
					<p>A variety of defects may be induced in the blood including hypoxia, haemolysis, aplasia, coagulopathy and hypocalcaemia.&nbsp; Agents acting directly on the lipid or protein structure of the erythrocyte may cause a massive haemolytic crisis with haemoglobinuria and haemoglobin nephrosis (e.g. arsine).&nbsp; Haemolysis can also result from the oxidative denaturation of haemoglobin with the formation of Heinz bodies leading to an increased fragility of the erythrocytes or to an increased rate of erythrocyte destruction.&nbsp; The resulting aplastic anaemia is usually accompanied by a granulocytopaenia and thrombocytopaenia.</p>

					<p class="sgH3">Respiratory System</p>
					<p>The exposure to lung
damaging chemicals may occur by aerogenous or haematogenous routes.&nbsp; Toxicity is affected by the size of the inhaled particle and the route by which it is excreted (i.e. some volatile chemicals are concentrated at the pulmonary membranes during expiration).&nbsp; The response of the lung to toxicants generally includes irritation, necrosis, fibrosis or suppressed immunologic function.&nbsp; As with other systemic diseases the rate and depth of respiration may be significantly altered in a poisoned animal.&nbsp; The odour of the animal's breath, may indicate a likely toxin.</p>

										<p>The external features of the carcass, the colour of the mucous membranes and skin, and any discharges apparent from the body openings should be noted, then a careful and systematic examination of all the body systems is performed.&nbsp; When the abdominal cavity or stomach is opened, the odour, if any, should be noted and a careful search of the stomach contents should be made for recognisable or suspicious traces of poison or poisonous plants.&nbsp; Care should be taken not to spill the stomach contents as these may contain valuable material for analysis.&nbsp; Grey
white specks may indicate arsenic trioxide or flakes of paint for lead poisoning.&nbsp; Similarly the leaves of some plants can be easily recognised in the rumen e.g. tutu.&nbsp; The colour of the stomach contents may also be significant; see Table 4.</p>

										<p>Toxic changes are less apparent in the rumen as the large volume of ingesta dilutes the toxin, and the rumen is lined with keratinised tissue.&nbsp; A similar procedure of examination should be followed for the small and large intestines.</p>
										<p>Hepatic and renal lesions are frequently seen as these organs are the main routes of metabolism and excretion for most toxins.&nbsp; However the damage to renal and hepatic tissues is generally not specific.</p>
										<p>The body musculature may show a peculiar colour, e.g. lead poisoning, or jaundice, or show signs of bruising and haemorrhage e.g. warfarin, bracken fern poisoning or sweet clover disease.</p>
										<p>If the history indicates involvement of the nervous system, the brain and spinal cord should be examined and removed for further detailed examination.</p>
										<p class="sgH3">Tissue samples&nbsp;for analysis and histopathology</p>
										<p>Dispatch of Material</p>
										<p>Ideally the samples are dispatched to the laboratory as soon as possible.&nbsp; However, under certain circumstances, the samples need to be preserved.&nbsp; Refrigeration or freezing is usually suitable to delay putrefaction.&nbsp; Slicker pads should be placed with samples which are dispatched.&nbsp; However, if the dispatch is delayed, then chemical preservatives are necessary.&nbsp; Use ethyl alcohol, not aldehydes or denatured alcohols, and include a sample of the preservative as a control 
 but check with the courier first as these are all hazardous substances.&nbsp; Do not allow the samples preserved for histopathology to come in contact with those for chemical analysis.</p>
										<p>The sample containers must be chemically inert, fluid tight and well labelled with the organ, case number, name and address of the sender and species.&nbsp; Each organ sample should be kept in a separate, well labelled container<b>.</b></p>
										<p>Samples for Chemical Analysis (<a href="TrSmpl.html">details</a>)</p>
										<p>Ensure that the correct samples for analysis are collected.&nbsp; The samples needed for toxicological analysis are liver, kidney, stomach contents, intestinal contents, blood and urine.&nbsp; At least 50g of each organ should be sent or the whole organ if it weighs less.&nbsp; Approximately 10mls of blood, EDTA or heparin and as much urine as is available, is to be collected.&nbsp; The stomach may be tied off at each end and sent complete with its contents.&nbsp; When in doubt, it is always better to send too much rather than too little.&nbsp; In the case of small animals it is sometimes better to send the whole animal (particularly birds and neonates).&nbsp; Do not submit toxicological specimens known to, or likely to contain agents dangerous to laboratory staff, without contacting the laboratory for advice.</p>
										<p>Tissue Samples for Histopathology</p>
									</div>
									<p>An histopathological examination is indicated for any organs which are grossly abnormal or which are suspected to be diseased.&nbsp; In most instances liver, kidney, lung and brain sections should be sent. Samples for histopathology should be collected as early as possible and placed in fluid tight, correctly labelled containers in 10% formalin (10% formalin is nine volumes of water to one volume of commercial formalin). Use a volume of formalin that is 10 times greater than the volume of tissue to assure adequate fixation.</p>
									<p>The brain requires special handling, because lesions and/or infections are often localised to specific regions.&nbsp; Aim to remove the brain whole, then divide it longitudinally (in the midline).&nbsp; Fix one half and submit the other half unpreserved for chemical analysis.&nbsp; The cerebral hemispheres alone are usually of little value, and the cerebellum and brainstem should always be included.&nbsp; In small animals the spinal cord can be obtained by removing the dorsal half of the vertebrae.&nbsp; In large animals, the entire spinal column (divided into cervical, thoracic and lumbar segments) should be submitted to the laboratory.</p>

					<p>The final proof of poisoning lies in the detection of a significant quantity of the toxic agent in the body of an animal.&nbsp; However, toxicological analysis of tissues is not always easy to perform and it is often not available at a reasonable cost.&nbsp; For many toxins, particularly the plant toxins, there are no reliable chemical tests.</p>
					<p>To test for a single poison or group of poisons is usually practicable, but to make a generalised search for a toxin is not.&nbsp; The function of a chemical analysis is to provide evidence to confirm a tentative diagnosis, and it is the responsibility of the veterinarian to suggest a likely toxin.&nbsp; To aid the laboratory in their analyses, a full clinical history, necropsy findings and details of any medicines given, should be sent with all the samples.&nbsp; Information on certain therapeutic compounds which may interfere with the analysis should be given.&nbsp; These can be erroneously identified as the toxin.&nbsp; If litigation is a possibility, then the laboratory should be warned, samples carefully identified and properly labelled. Meticulous records must be kept.</p>
					<p>Try to send a sample of the suspected toxic material.&nbsp; This is particularly helpful with organophosphates and other poisonings where standards for comparison may not be readily available to the laboratory.&nbsp; If this is a plant, send the leaves, flowers, fruit or roots. It is also a good idea to photograph the plant in its fresh state, ideally with a digital camera.</p>
