					<p>These classes of compound are used commonly in the home, on the farm, in kennels and in veterinary practices.&nbsp; They are often complex chemical mixtures which have been produced for specific purposes and to meet marketing competition.&nbsp; Unfortunately toxicoses produced by these mixtures and products are not always predictable from the chemical and physical properties of the ingredients.&nbsp; Exposure is generally by accidental ingestion or surface contact.&nbsp; It is not possible to give a full list of all the various proprietary products and their ingredients so that a few selected groups are presented which will cover most circumstances.&nbsp; Serious situations should be followed up by reference to either the manufacturer or the&nbsp; Poisons and Hazardous Chemicals, National Information Centre, Dunedin.</p>
					<p>Household products that are a significant poison hazard have warning labels and some are packaged in &quot;child
proof&quot; containers.&nbsp; Products for industrial use are generally more concentrated than those for household use.&nbsp; In both cases, inadvertent or careless use markedly increases the danger.</p>
					<p>Because most cleaning agents and disinfectants are complex mixtures, the most toxic ingredient must be evaluated when treating such a poison case.&nbsp; Obtaining the container of the suspected poison is an initial and essential step in the examination of the patient.</p>
					<p>The principal ingredients of cleaning agents are soap and/or detergent (surface
active agent or surfactant) which lowers the surface tension of water and allows wetting to occur.&nbsp; &quot;Builders&quot; are added to detergents to condition the water by regulating pH and ionic concentrations.&nbsp; Some cleaning agents such as automatic dishwashing detergents, and oven cleaners have a high alkalinity.&nbsp; Some agents contain pine oil, isopropyl alcohol and solvents.&nbsp; Oxalates are frequently found in lavatory cleaners.</p>
					<p>These pages contain general comments about the major detergents, bleaches, antiseptics and disinfectants used in home, farm or factory.&nbsp; In all circumstances read labels and try to ascertain what is the active ingredient(s) of the suspected poison and then use whatever treatment common sense principles suggest.</p>
					<p><a href="bloatRem.html">Bloat remedies</a> are a special class of detergent. They are much less toxic than other detergents, but as calves are much more susceptible than adult cattle, poisoning is relatively common.</p>
