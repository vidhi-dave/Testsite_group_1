					<p>Ethylene glycol (1,2 ethanediol) poisoning has been seen in man, dogs, cats, poultry and calves.&nbsp; It is not a common intoxicant in NZ, but is reported frequently in some countries. It is a serious life threatening emergency characterised by hypersomolality, a large anion gap metabolic acidosis, and oliguric or anuric renal failure.</p>

					<p>Ethylene glycol has excellent properties as a vehicle and hygroscopic liquid, and it is used in the manufacture of detergents, paints, lacquers, alkylated resin, pharmaceuticals, polishes, plastics, cosmetics, printing inks and inks for ballpoint pens.&nbsp; Ethylene glycol is also used as a solvent for borates and boric acid in electrolytic condensers, as a stabilizer for soyabean foams in fire extinguishers and in the manufacture of explosives.</p>
					<p>However, most poisonings occur as a result of the ingestion of car antifreeze solutions (95% ethylene glycol), and to a lesser extent colour film processing solutions.&nbsp; Most antifreeze products now include colouring dye so that adult people do not mistake it for water or a soft drink, but this safety precaution does not deter children and animals.</p>
					<p>In areas subjected to particularly cold weathers, antifreeze is often added to the toilet, and this may be the only source of unfrozen water available to animals.&nbsp; In New Zealand, in one of the few cases reported, eight out of sixteen muscovy ducks were found dead following a hard frost.&nbsp; These ducks had been drinking from puddles that were a mixture of antifreeze and water, pure water puddles were frozen over.</p>
					<p>Poisonings of cats in the South Island, which were thought to be malicious, were reported in 1999.</p>

					<p>Ethylene glycol is a colourless, odourless, palatable sweet tasting liquid.&nbsp; It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed to the blood and tissues throughout the body.&nbsp; Peak blood levels normally occur within one to three hours following ingestion, but the presence of food in the stomach may delay absorption.&nbsp; Ethylene glycol has a plasma half
life of between 6 and 16 hours.</p>
					<p>The majority of ingested ethylene glycol is excreted unchanged in the urine.&nbsp; Depending on the poisoned animal species, 0.05
3.7% of the ingested dose is broken down (primarily in the liver and to a lesser degree in the kidneys).</p>

					<p>Ethylene glycol is degraded into glycoaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (figure 9).&nbsp; This is rapidly converted to glycolic acid (hydroxy acetic acid) and then glyoxylic acid (formylformic acid).&nbsp; Glyoxylic acid enters into the various pathways of intermediary metabolism; one of which produces oxalic acid.&nbsp; Other products include formic acid, glycine, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
					<p>A small part of the oxalic acid combines with serum calcium and forms a soluble calcium oxalate complex in the blood stream which is filtered by the glomerulus.&nbsp; Ethylene glycol is more toxic in species like the cat, that excrete the most oxalate and unchanged ethylene glycol in the urine, and is less toxic in species such as ruminants which can metabolise the substance to carbon dioxide and water.&nbsp; As water is reabsorbed by the tubules, the pH of the tubular filtrate drops and the calcium oxalate precipitates to form crystals.&nbsp; Precipitation of these crystals is enhanced when the urine volume is small or the amount of oxalic acid relatively large.&nbsp; The crystals are light yellow, arranged in rosettes, sheaves or prisms and are birefringent when viewed by polarized light.</p>

					<p>Ethylene glycol intoxication has a high mortality and a successful outcome requires an early diagnosis and appropriate therapy.&nbsp; The clinical signs are similar in all species, and the severity of intoxication is related to the time interval and dose ingested.&nbsp; They can be classified into three phases the onset and progression of which are variable and unpredictable.
					<p class="sgH3">Acute Phase (Stage I)</p>
					<p>The acute phase occurs within 0.5
6 hours after ingestion of large quantities of ethylene glycol.&nbsp; The early signs of intoxication include a gastroenteritis, due to mucosal irritation and central nervous signs, similar to alcohol inebriation. Other signs reported in the first six hours are hypothermia (especially in cats), tachycardia, diuresis, polydipsia and dehydration. In the dog but not in the cat, a marked and progressive polydipsia develop from one hour post
ingestion. Severe polyuria is common in both species that can result in serious dehydration and hypoperfusion.</p>
					<p>Vomiting or nausea occurs partly due to the irritant effects of ethylene glycol, and partly by activation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone.&nbsp; Ataxia with abnormal placing and righting reflexes are followed by a coma or convulsions.&nbsp; A metabolic acidosis develops due to the rapid production of lactic acid and ethylene glycol metabolites (of which glyoxylic acid is probably the major toxic component).&nbsp; A polydipsia develops early in the course of the disease, and is proportional to the amount of ethylene glycol ingested. After the initial CNS depression, animals may seem to recover for a period only to rapidly deteriorate.</p>
					<p>Death in the acute stage is probably due to the severe metabolic acidosis and dehydration, combined with depression of the respiratory centres.&nbsp; Animals which die in the first twenty
four hours usually do not have calcium oxalate crystals in their renal tubules.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Stage II</p>
					<p>Cardiopulmonary signs are prominent in this stage, which occur 12 to 24 hours following ingestion, as the ethylene glycol molecules undergo hepatic biotransformation.</p>
					<p>Tachycardia, rapid respiration, pulmonary oedema, heart failure and progressive hypothermia are the most important signs.&nbsp; Certain nervous signs 
 weakness, ataxia, muscle fasciculations, a paralysis that starts caudally and progresses forward, reduced reflex responsiveness and prolonged central nervous depression may also be present.</p>
					<p>Oliguria or anuria may also be found at this stage and what urine there is, is usually coffee coloured.&nbsp; Examination of the urinary sediment may demonstrate calcium oxalate crystals (0.3% to 2.5% of ingested ethylene glycol is excreted as oxalic acid), but these are more consistently present in man.&nbsp; Calcium oxalate crystals are not apparent in the urine until at least six hours after ingestion.&nbsp; Approximately 0.1% ethylene glycol is excreted as hippuric acid and hippurate crystalluria is more common in animals.</p>
					<p>Serum chemistry shows an increase in potassium, phosphorus, urea and creatinine levels.&nbsp; Serum calcium may be low due to binding with oxalate crystals.&nbsp; Hypocalcaemia has been reported in some dogs and cats poisoned with ethylene glycol and this has probably contributed to the nervous signs recorded.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Chronic Phase (Stage III)</p>
					<p>This is the most commonly seen phase and it is the result of toxic damage to the kidney.&nbsp; Renal failure may follow an apparent recovery from the acute stages, or appear 24 - 72 hours after the animal has drunk a small amount of ethylene glycol.&nbsp; Clinical signs are those of acute renal failure, including oliguria, depression, vomiting, and painful swollen kidneys.</p>
					<p>For the first 48 hours after ingestion of ethylene glycol, the excretory renal function remains normal.&nbsp; As the renal failure progresses, there is a rise in both BUN and inorganic serum phosphate.&nbsp; Inorganic serum phosphorus also rises.&nbsp; Other blood chemistry findings include a low serum calcium, reduced blood bicarbonate, blood pH less than 7.3, a stress leucogram, hyperglycaemia and increased serum concentrations of amylase and lipase.&nbsp; Urinalysis may demonstrate proteinuria, glucosuria, haematuria, calcium oxalate and/or hippurate crystals, renal epithelial cells, white blood cells and granular casts.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Retinal detachment and retinal oedema has been reported in a blind kitten during recovery from ethylene glycol intoxication.&nbsp; This toxic retinopathy gradually resolved and the animal regained its vision.</p>
					<p>Swine show characteristic signs in the chronic phase. &nbsp;Affected animals are reluctant to move, and often have fluid in the abdomen and thorax.&nbsp; The latter can be demonstrated by muffled heart sounds.&nbsp; Animals are generally in sternal recumbency.</p>

					</table>&nbsp;When death occurs in the acute stages, the most consistent necropsy findings are a general congestion of all organs, with petechial haemorrhages of the gastric or intestinal mucosa, and pulmonary oedema.&nbsp; Usually there are no crystals in the renal tubules.&nbsp; Pulmonary congestion and oedema, often with accompanying heart failure are evident following the second stage.&nbsp; In the chronic poisoning phase the most significant changes occur in the kidneys which are swollen and streaked with yellow
grey material and histologically, pale yellow crystals of calcium oxalate may be seen in the tubules, with sloughing and necrosis of the epithelial cells.&nbsp; Calcium oxalate crystals may also be found in and around the small blood vessel walls in brain and muscle tissue.<p>Necropsy of swine following chronic poisoning reveals the findings previously described, as well as a hydrothorax, abdominal wall oedema, peritoneal oedema, oedema of the terminal colon and mesometrium and lateral ligaments of the bladder.&nbsp; The kidneys show petechial and ecchymotic haemorrhages.</p>

					<p>Early diagnosis of ethylene glycol toxicity is difficult due to the nonspecific clinical signs, and the rapid metabolism and excretion of ethylene glycol.&nbsp; Serum glycolic acid and urinary ethylene glycol can be measured by HPLC.&nbsp; Ethylene glycol can be detected in the urine, before calcium oxalate crystals form in the kidney.</p>
					<p>Urinalysis and haematology suggestive of kidney damage are useful diagnostic aids.&nbsp; Urine sediment can be examined for calcium oxalate crystals.</p>
					<p>Serum osmolality and osmolal gaps are significantly increased by 1 hour after ethylene glycol ingestion in both dogs and cats. Increase in osmolality and the anion gap which is calculated by subtracting the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate from the sum of serum sodium and potassium.&nbsp; Normally this difference is approximately 10 - 12 mEq/L.&nbsp; Anion gaps greater than 40 - 50 mEq/L are considered typical of ethylene glycol poisoning.</p>
					<p>Isosthenuria may occur as early as 3 hours after ingestion. Calcium oxalate crystalluria may appear in urine as early as 3 hours after ingestion in the cat and 4
6 hours in the dog. Some ethylene glycol mixtures (anti
freeze mixtures) contain phosphate rust inhibitors which may elevate inorganic phosphorus soon after ingestion.</p>

					<p>There are 3 main objectives for the treatment of ethylene glycol intoxication.</p>
					<div>
						<ul>
							<li>to reduce the load of the ethylene glycol substrate in the body.&nbsp; This is achieved with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, bicarbonate therapy and peritoneal dialysis;
							<li>to reverse the metabolic acidosis produced by the formation of glycolic acid;&nbsp; and
							<li>to reduce the quantity of metabolites formed.
						</ul>
						<p>If the animal is presented within 2 hours of ingestion an emetic may be indicated. Gastric lavage with 5% bicarbonate solution and activated charcoal will remove and reduce the absorption of ethylene glycol, if given early in the poisoning.</p>
						<p><a href="TrConv.html">Convulsions</a> can be controlled with diazepam 0.5mg/kg.&nbsp; If barbiturates are used, care must be taken to use small doses to avoid compounding the respiratory depression.&nbsp; Respiratory stimulants are not recommended as they may induce convulsions, aggravate the metabolic acidosis, and the positive effect on respiration is doubtful.</p>
						<p>Successful treatment in dogs and cats depends on the repeated systemic administration of solutions of 20% ethanol and sodium bicarbonate. The treatment is based upon the ethanol blocking the enzymes responsible for metabolising ethylene glycol into the more toxic end products.&nbsp; Ethanol competitively inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase allowing more ethylene glycol to be excreted in the urine. Ethanol must be administered within 18 hours of ingestion before all the ethylene glycol has been metabolised. In dogs the optimal dose levels are 5.5 ml of 20% ethanol/kg of bodyweight IV and 8.0 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate given by an intraperitoneal injection.&nbsp; This treatment must be repeated every 4 hours for a total of 5 treatments and then every 6 hours for 4 additional treatments. It may be necessary to maintain a blood level of ethanol for 72 hours as it will prolong the elimination time (half life) of ethylene glycol. In cats the recommended dosage is 5 mL/kg of a 20% solution of ethanol and 6 mL/kg of a 5% bicarbonate solution. Both are given IP every 6 hours for 5 treatments and then every 8 hours for 4 more treatments.</p>
						<p>An alternative treatment to ethanol in the dog is fomepizole (4 methylpyrazole) which is similar to the actions of ethanol but it is more effective and has fewer side effects. It is ineffective in cats. It is available commercially overseas but until a licensed product is obtainable it can be purchased from chemical suppliers.&nbsp; A sterile solution will need to be made, preferably by a pharmacist. The recommended dosage for the dog is an initial IV dose of 20 mg/kg using a 5% solution of fomepizole, then 15 mg/kg IV at 12 and 24 hours and finally 5 mg/kg at 36 hours. Further doses of 5 mg/kg at 12 hour intervals may be administered if necessary. To prepare the solution of fomepizole combine 5 grams of fomepizole with 45 ml of polyethylene glycol 400. Then, with continuous stirring, 50 ml of bacteriostatic water is slowly added. The solution is then filtered with a 0.22&micro;m syringe filter. The solution is stable for a year if it is stored in a refrigerator.</p>
						<p>The administration of sodium bicarbonate prevents and/or reverses the acidosis, favours increased excretion of the unmetabolised ethylene glycol and reduces calcium oxalate formation by raising urinary pH.&nbsp; The renal excretion of ethylene glycol is further aided by the volume of fluids administered and the availability of drinking water.&nbsp; The ethanol
induced depression becomes progressively shorter as treatment is successful.&nbsp; Sodium bicarbonate therapy should be based on serial plasma bicarbonate and base deficit determinations.&nbsp; Administer the sodium bicarbonate slowly.</p>
					</div>
					 Symptomatic treatment with mannitol or frusemide is important.&nbsp; While not readily available, the application of haemodialysisis can be useful.&nbsp; Peritoneal dialysis is a compromise to haemodialysis.

					<p>Animals that regain consciousness, begin to drink water and perhaps walk with difficulty after the third or fourth treatments may reasonably be estimated to have absorbed limited amounts of ethylene glycol.&nbsp; The prognosis for these animals is fair.&nbsp; Patients that do not regain consciousness between treatments are unlikely to recover.&nbsp; Dogs presented in a coma have a very poor prognosis.</p>
