					<p>Cyanide is extremely toxic to all species of animal, including humans.&nbsp; It is still used as a vermicide and is found in the effluent of some industrial processes.&nbsp; The most important source of cyanide to domestic animals is from plant material containing hydrocyanic acid, either in the free form or as cyanogenetic glycosides. </p>
					<p>All species can be affected.&nbsp; In NZ cyanide poisoning is most commonly recorded in cattle, sheep and dogs. </p>

					<p>Because of its extreme solubility, hydrocyanic acid&nbsp;(prussic acid, HCN) is one of the most toxic and rapidly acting of the common poisons.&nbsp; Its sodium and potassium salts are only slightly less toxic while the complex cyanides, the thiocyanates, are almost non toxic.</p>
					<p><b>Calcium cyanide</b> was once used as a rabbit poison.&nbsp; It is no longer available.&nbsp; The cyanide was placed in the burrow which was sealed off. The hydrolysis of the calcium cyanide in the damp atmosphere gave off cyanide gas.</p>
					<p> <b>Sodium cyanide</b> is still used to control possums and on occasions rabbits and wallaby. In spite of its risk to humans and livestock, it has a number of advantages. It is inexpensive and convenient to use. The lethal dose for a large number of animals can be carried by operators working on foot. Possums die quickly after eating the paste.&nbsp; Dead animals are usually found close to where the poison was laid. Further it does not leave poisonous residues which are likely to be a long term environmental hazard. There are antidotes and measures for human treatment if inadvertent cyanide poisoning occurs. The disadvantage is that survivors of sub
lethal doses recognise the poison and become bait shy.&nbsp; To obviate bait shyness pre
feed pastes or lures are used to acquaint the target animals with the material.&nbsp; Non toxic lures of great variety are marketed as allspice, almond, aniseed, bayleaf, curry, cinnamon, cloves, eucalyptus, ginerine, lemon, nutmeg and peppermint.</p>
					<p>The cyanide paste is lured and dyed green (by law) and dispensed in 500gm tubes.&nbsp; It is kept at low temperatures to ensure a long shelf life.&nbsp; The baits are available through regional pest destruction organisations or appropriate government agencies. Only licensed operators or a person under the direct supervision of a licensed operator can apply toxic paste.</p>
					<p><b>Potassium cyanide</b>. An encapsulated form of cyanide (coated potassium cyanide) was introduced into New Zealand for use under licence in 1997. This material can be used with a pelleted feed in a bait station. It is less likely to produce bait shyness and to present risks to non
target species and it is less hazardous for operators.</p>
					<p><b>Cyanogenetic glycosides </b>By far the most important source of cyanide to animals is from plant material containing hydrocyanic acid either free or in the form of cyanogenetic glycosides (organic compounds capable of yielding cyanide on hydrolysis).&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp; Cyanogenetic plants&nbsp;are found in many countries and include:</p>
					<p>i.&nbsp; Weeds e.g. native couch (<i>Brachyachne convergens</i>) members of the flax family.</p>
					<p>ii.&nbsp; Reed sweet grass (<i>Poa aquatica</i>) 
 can contain up to 1.52mg HCN/g dry matter.&nbsp; Found especially in wet places in Otago and Southland.&nbsp; This species has been responsible for a number of cattle deaths in NZ.</p>
					<p>iii.&nbsp; Johnson grass (<i>Sorghum halepense</i>).</p>
					<p>iv.&nbsp; Sudan grass (<i>S. sudanense</i>).</p>
					<p>v.&nbsp; Sorghum (<i>S. vulgare</i>).</p>
					<p>&nbsp; Toxicity of the latter two species is reduced if the plants are in flower before they are grazed.&nbsp; Hybrids of Sorghum spp. and Sudan grass are usually more toxic than the pure species.&nbsp; &quot;Sudax&quot; is a hybrid of Sudan and Sorghum grass which was responsible for a number of cattle deaths.&nbsp; This summer growing annual is planted in various parts of Northland and is most toxic in February and March.</p>
					<p>vi.&nbsp; Linseed in the form of cake or meal may be toxic if eaten in large quantities (sheep) or if not boiled (calves).&nbsp; Linseed is grown as a winter crop in Australia and has been used in NZ and all parts of the plant have proven toxic from time to time.</p>
					<p>vii.&nbsp; Some clovers especially white clover (<i>Trifolium repens</i>).</p>
					<p>viii.&nbsp; Some members of the <a href="poisonplants/data/cabbage/cabbage.html">Brassica</a> genus.</p>
					<p>&nbsp; A number of glycosides have been isolated and these are by
products of plant metabolism.&nbsp; Their concentration in the different species is variable depending on climate and other conditions which influence plant growth.</p>
					<p>&nbsp; Plants which may contain dangerous levels of hydrocyanic acid are:</p>

					(Many of these are found world wide.)
					<p>Some examples of these are <i>Eremophila maculata</i> and <i>Heterodendrum oleifolium</i> which are both found in inland regions of Australia and can cause cyanide poisoning of hungry animals.&nbsp; Also African star grass <i>Cynodon nlemfuensis</i> and blue couch <i>Cynodon incompletus</i> are found in Queensland and New South Wales respectively.&nbsp; Many of the other species are common botanical names and found in gardens worldwide e.g. <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Hydrangea</i>, <i>Prunus</i> (Cherry, apricot and peach) and <i>Grevillea</i> or among pastures and bush or forest e.g. <i>Trifolium</i> (white clover) and <i>Eucalyptus</i>.</p>

					<p>The cyanogenetic glycosides found in plants are non toxic until they come into contact with the appropriate enzyme, which decomposes the glycosides and liberates hydrocyanic acid.&nbsp; The reaction does not occur in the intact plant, but once the plant tissue is damaged or starts to decompose, then the plant becomes toxic.&nbsp; Treating the plants with nitrogenous fertilizers, or with herbicides such as <a href="24d.html">2,4 D</a> increases the cyanide content.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Some twenty one glycosides are known of the hydroxynitrile group.&nbsp; In most cases it is believed that the action of two enzymes is required to release the HCN.&nbsp; When the plants are crushed, the enzyme &szlig; glycosidase is able to come into contact with the glycoside and release a hydroxynitrile aglycone.&nbsp; This may break down spontaneously to HCN but plants contain lyases which can catalyse this reaction as well.&nbsp; The cyanogenetic aglycone breaks down to HCN and an aldehyde or ketone characteristic of the parent glycoside.</p>
					
					<p>The single lethal oral dose&nbsp;of HCN for a ruminant is about 2 mg/kg body weight.&nbsp; Animals rarely consume sufficient cyanogenetic glycoside at a rate that will yield this dose and released HCN is absorbed and excreted without becoming toxic.&nbsp; Cyanide is excreted from the lungs or is converted in the liver to thiocyanate by the action of rhonadase.&nbsp; Thiocyanate is then excreted in the urine.</p>
					
					<p>In practice, poisoning is most likely to occur when the cyanide content of the plant material is high.&nbsp; Plants grow rapidly after autumn rains or following nitrogen fertilizer application.&nbsp; Also wilted or frost bitten plants may be dangerous and favour the release of HCN.</p>
					
					<p>The rate of ingestion of toxic plants and the rate of release of HCN and the animals ability to detoxify the released HCN are all factors which determine if intoxication will occur.&nbsp; Hence hungry animals suddenly given potentially dangerous fodder are likely to be at greater risk than animals which are experienced with the dangerous material.</p>
					<p>Monogastric animals are comparatively resistant to poisoning by cyanogenetic glycosides.&nbsp; Sheep are more resistant than cattle and some breeds of cattle are more resistant to poisoning than others.&nbsp; Hereford cattle are believed to be less susceptible than other breeds.</p>

The lethal effect of cyanide is due to the inactivation of the cytochrome oxidase system which is essential for tissue respiration. Cyanide forms a stable complex with Fe<sup>+3</sup> which prevents electron transport and cellular respiration. The oxygen exchange between tissues and blood is stopped, so that initially the blood appears bright red because oxygen is retained in the blood.&nbsp; As the intoxication progresses, the blood becomes dark due to the inhibition of respiration.&nbsp; Anoxia occurs in all tissues, but death occurs primarily from tissue anoxia within the brain.</p>

					<p>In acute poisoning, death usually occurs within a few minutes. Initial signs may include salivation and rapid breathing. A marked dyspnoea, weakness, muscle fasciculations, urination, defaecation, rapid heart rate, staggering and mydriasis may follow. In some cases, paralysis, stupor and terminal convulsions with respiratory arrest may be observed.&nbsp; Animals that survive for two or more hours generally survive.</p>
					
					<p>The time of onset of clinical signs is dependent on the rate of ingestion and the hydrolysis, absorption and detoxification of the cyanogenetic glycosides.&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p>Persistent consumption of cyanogenetic plants has been associated with ataxia in horses and cattle with axonal neuropathy of central pathways and lateral columns of the spinal cord.&nbsp; Cystitis and urinary incontinence usually accompany the condition.</p>
					
					<p>It should be noted that cyanide ingested in small amounts is known to be goitrogenic and may be important in contributing to clinical goitre of lambs which have marginal uptakes of iodine in their diets.</p>
					<p>A detailed study of the clinical signs shown in possums dying following the ingestion of cyanide either as a paste or pellet is shown in Table&nbsp; 36. The average time to onset of ataxia is 3 minutes, to loss of consciousness 6.5 minutes and to death (cessation of breathing) 18 minutes.</p>

					<p>The clinical and post mortem findings are not necessarily pathognomonic for cyanide poisoning.&nbsp; A definitive diagnosis requires chemical analysis of the ruminal or stomach contents, liver and muscle.&nbsp; However cyanide in the ruminal contents is not always significant as a small amount of hydrocyanic acid is normally found in the rumen.&nbsp; As hydrocyanic acid is volatile it may be lost from the specimen during transit so that all specimens should be immersed in 0.1% mercuric chloride solution (1% stock solution diluted 1:9 mls of water) or sent in well sealed bottles, preferably quick frozen with dry ice.&nbsp; Skeletal muscle is the preferred tissue, as little detoxification of the tissue occurs, so the cyanide loss is reduced.&nbsp; Liver tissue by contrast rapidly loses cyanide gas.&nbsp; Tissue specimens must be taken very soon after death as degenerating tissue frequently contains a trace of HCN and cyanogenetic plants may release a great deal of HCN after death of the animal. The concentration of cyanide in tissues may decrease to one
third of the initial concentration in the first hour after death.</p>

					<p>Obviously any treatment, to be successful, must be initiated very rapidly after exposure to cyanide.&nbsp; The cyanide radical forms complexes with a number of other chemicals within tissues, and this property is used as the basis for therapy.&nbsp; Intravenously administered sodium nitrite converts some haemoglobin into methaemoglobin.&nbsp; Methaemoglobin combines with hydrocyanic acid to produce cyanomethaemoglobin which is non
toxic.&nbsp; Sodium thiosulphate is then given intravenously, so that as the hydrocyanic acid is gradually released from the methaemoglobin complex it is taken up by the thiosulphate ion to form non
toxic thiocyanate which can be excreted in the urine.</p>

					<p>Care must be taken to avoid a nitrite toxicosis.</p>
					
					<p>Either sodium nitrite or sodium thiosulphate can be given alone (the dose of sodium thiosulphate must be doubled) but the clinical response is more effective with the combination.&nbsp; Treat all exposed animals if possible.&nbsp; Many animals will cope with high levels of HCN and recover if moved carefully to new pasture or given hay.</p>
					
					<p>Large doses of hydroxycobalamin (Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) may have some value in therapy.&nbsp; The cobalt in these preparations may complex with additional cyanide in the circulation.</p>
					<p>Other therapeutic measures include cooling, diluting and acidifying the ruminal contents by giving the cow 4L of vinegar in 12
20L of cold water.&nbsp; This slows microbial hydrolysis of the cyanogenetic glycoside.&nbsp; Mineral oil may also be administered to sooth the irritated gut.</p>

					<p>Because of the extreme nature of cyanide poisoning it is important that veterinarians have some basic idea of how to treat or deal with such an emergency.&nbsp; Should an operator, adult or even more likely a child accidentally consume cyanide paste, death is highly likely unless effective action is taken quickly.</p>
					<p>Usually no effects would be noticed with small doses for several minutes after taking the poison.&nbsp; Then there would be dizziness, headache, palpitation and difficulty in&nbsp; breathing.&nbsp; This would be followed by unconsciousness and violent convulsions.&nbsp; The mortality from this form of cyanide poisoning is high but if a patient survives for an hour recovery is the rule.</p>
					
					<p>Amyl nitrate pearls can be broken on to a handkerchief and given every five minutes <b><u>but a doctor should be called immediately.</u></b>&nbsp; If the patient is conscious salt and warm water or a mustard and water emetic can be given.&nbsp; If breathing stops artificial respiration should be given <b><u>but the mouth
to
mouth or mouth
to
nose method must not be used</u></b>.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Handling precautions</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Store cyanide paste, palleted bait and cyanogas in locked rooms or cupboards where children or unauthorised persons cannot get at them.
						<li>Place baits where children will not be endangered by them.
						<li>Do not let cyanide paste or cyanogas come in contact with acids, particularly indoors.
						<li>Wear gloves when handling cyanide paste, pellets or cyanide containing tissues or rumen contents.&nbsp; Wash the hands before eating or smoking.
						<li>Be conversant with the first aid methods to be used in cyanide poisoning but use the poisons in a way that will make first
aid unnecessary.<li>Make sure that cyanogas tins are well sealed so that dangerous concentrations of gas do not build up in store rooms.&nbsp; (No longer used in NZ).
