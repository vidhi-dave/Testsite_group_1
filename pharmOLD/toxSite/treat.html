					<p>All cases of poisoning should be considered as emergencies and treatment should be started as soon as possible. The initial treatment will be aimed at stabilizing the patient until the toxic agent can be identified and antidotal therapy may be given. In general treatment is directed along three lines which are as follows.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Remove the source of poison and deal with any life
threatening conditions.<li>Limit the further absorption of the poison and hasten its elimination from the patient's body. In other words thoroughly decontaminate the animal.
						<li>Reduce the effects of the poison by both symptomatic and supportive therapy and if the poison has been identified apply specific antidotes if they are available.
					</ol>
					<p>The preliminary advice given to the client at the initial contact is very important and often has a profound effect on the success of any subsequent treatment.</p>

					<p>Removal of the animal from the source of poison, if it is known, is most important. In the case of grazing animals and animals which have died in a certain paddock, the rest of the flock or herd should be quickly moved to a new location but without getting them excited. Such a move may be only temporary for example, in nitrate/nitrite poisoning the toxic level of some pasture species is only high for a brief period. Alternatively if the source of poison is not known then time is gained while the environment is thoroughly searched for the toxic plants or material. The provision of fresh water in such instances is also important as many toxicological conditions cause severe dehydration of the affected animals.</p>
					<p>In the case of pets or small animals the client should be instructed to keep the animal quiet and warm. In some cases instructions such as muzzling a large dog may be necessary to avoid the owner or other onlookers from being hurt. (Many poisoned animals have violent nervous signs which are quite out of character with the animals usual demeanour).</p>

					<p>If the poison is on the skin e.g. insecticides or corrosive chemicals, the client should be instructed to wash the animal(s) with copious amounts of warm water. It is best not to use soap or detergents as these may facilitate further absorption of the poison. In most instances it would be wise to warn owners to take precautions themselves, by wearing protective clothing, in particular gloves.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Induction of vomiting by the owner</p>
					<p>In the case of recently ingested poisons, the owner can attempt to induce vomiting, but before doing so the veterinarian should make the following points.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>i. If the chemical was caustic or corrosive, induced vomiting may cause further oral or oesophageal damage. A careful look at the mouth or paws of a cat or dog may indicate corrosive lesions. In the case of suspected acid or alkali contact or ingestion, advise the owner to give milk or water.</p>
						<p>ii. Forced vomiting should never be recommended if the patient is severely depressed, comatose, or having intermittent seizures or convulsions.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>To induce vomiting the owner may use one of the following (it is important to recognise that no treatment is totally satisfactory for emptying the stomach):</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>i. a small quantity or pinch of <strong>washing soda</strong> (sodium carbonate) placed on the back of the tongue, or a 1% solution of <strong>copper or zinc sulphate</strong> (10 - 30mL for dogs, 3 - 10mL for cats) are all procedures which may be recommended in an emergency. As little as 40 mg of copper sulphate will induce emesis in the dog.</p>
						<p>ii. 3% <strong>hydrogen peroxide</strong> 1 - 3 teaspoons for small animals or 1 - 3 mL/kg (1 teaspoon = 5 mL) orally, repeat at 10 minute intervals up to three times. Do not confuse with concentrated hydrogen peroxide used as a bleaching agent.</p>
						<p>iii. Dry <strong>mustard</strong> 1 - 4 teaspoons in 250 mLs (cup) of water.</p>
						<p>iv. <strong>Liquid dishwashing detergent</strong> (but not laundry or electric dishwashing detergents) are generally effective. The dose is 3 tablespoons in 250 mL of water, given at 10 mL/kg or 2 teaspoons/kg.</p>
						<p>v. Table <strong>salt</strong> 1 - 3 teaspoonsful in warm water given orally. This is not very effective and can cause hypernatraemia. Use as a <strong>last resort only</strong> if no other emetics are available in the home.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of these home remedies the crystal of washing soda and copper and zinc sulphate are the most effective. The amount of food in the stomach affects the success of the emetic. In the case of a low volume, highly toxic compound, feeding just before giving the emetic may be beneficial. Avoid fatty foods that may enhance the absorption of lipid soluble agents.</p>
					<p>The animal should be given access to fresh water, egg white and milk. The latter two materials are useful adsorbents, particularly for corrosive materials. If the dog or cat does vomit and the vomitus can be collected in a suitable container the owner should be asked to bring this to the clinic for further analysis.</p>

					<p>With farm animals the degree of medication and emergency treatment possible may be limited by the number of animals and the ability of veterinarian and owner to deal with so many animals quickly. Specific instructions for each toxicosis of farm animals is given, where applicable, in later sections. The following recommendations generally apply to pet or small animals.However many of the principles can be used in farm animal therapy as well. The management of the poisoning should be done in an organised sequence: </p>
					<ol>
						<li>stabilise the animal's vital signs
						<li>clinically evaluate the animal
						<li>prevent continued exposure to the poison
						<li>administer an antidote if available
						<li>facilitate removal of the poison
						<li>supportive therapy and observation.
					</ol>
					<p>It is important to remember to treat the patient not the poison.</p>
					<p>When the animal is first seen by the veterinarian, the initial treatment is aimed at managing any life
threatening conditions regardless of whether or not the poison is known. An immediate examination of vital systems should be made and emergency therapy begun according to the ABCD mnemonic i.e. airways, breathing, circulation, drugs.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Examination of the patient</p>
					<p>Ensure the animal has a patent airway and if necessary assist respiration by the administration of oxygen. Prevent the aspiration of vomitus. Anticonvulsant therapy may also be necessary at this stage and may include the use of diazepam which should be given slowly and iv (most species 0.5 mg/kg).</p>
					<p>Alternatively, sodium pentobarbitone may also be given iv to effect. The amount given will vary according to the individual and the effect produced. The dose used is calculated on the basis of 13 mg/kg bodyweight. From one third to half the dose may be given over a period of 10 seconds and the remainder should be given slowly over a period of several minutes. The depth of anaesthesia must be carefully checked and in the case of very sick animals the dose may need to be reduced. In some cases phenobarbitone (3 - 6 mg/kg slow iv) will be effective in <a href="TrConv.html">controlling seizures</a>. <span lang=EN-AU style="font-family:Symbol;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol"></span></p>
					<p>Where signs of shock or dehydration are apparent, iv fluids should be administered. Generally speaking, give balanced electrolyte solutions or saline to replace deficits, provide for ongoing losses and maintenance requirements. Excess fluid administration may result in pulmonary oedema while dehydration can be assessed in most animals by skin turgor or tenting. Blood samples for electrolyte, glucose and serum chemistry should be taken before fluids are given. Acid
base balance should be assessed and treated accordingly.</p>
					<p>Every attempt should be made to maintain the animal at near normal body temperature. If the animal is in hypothermia, blankets and a warm hot water bottle should be used.If the patient is conscious, warm milk or water may be given by mouth.If the animal is in hyperthermia, the temperature should be monitored and if it does not decrease (particularly once seizures are controlled) then a cold bath should be given.</p>
					<p>The patient's fluid balance should be adjusted according to acid base and electrolyte estimations to ensure an adequate output of urine. Sodium bicarbonate (0.5 - 2.0 mEq/kg every 4 hours iv) can be given for metabolic acidosis or to trap acidic drugs in the urine (e.g. aspirin). The dose should ideally be calculated from blood gas analysis, as an overdose is worse than not giving any bicarbonate.</p>

					</table>
					<p>Once the life
threatening situations are controlled, attention should be paid to the prevention of further absorption of the toxin, enhanced excretion and the application of specific or non
specific antidotal therapy.</p>
					<p>In the case of chemicals with which you are unfamiliar either a textbook or the poison control centre should be consulted.</p>

					<p>If the route of contact was oral then in the dog, cat or pig an emetic may be given. Emetics are most effective if given within 4 hours of the poison being ingested.</p>
					<p>Emetics are contraindicated in rodents, rabbits and horses because they cannot vomit safely. Care 
 if the chemical was a caustic or corrosive, induced vomiting may cause further oral or oesophageal damage. A careful look at the mouth or paws of a cat or dog may indicate corrosive lesions.</p>
					<p>Apomorphine is usually recommended in the dog, but it may add to the toxicity of the poison by causing respiratory depression and protracted vomiting. Crush a tablet of apomorphine, add to a small amount of sterile saline and administer subcunjunctivally for a dog. After the dog has vomited rinse the eye to remove the apomorphine. Alternatively a dose of 0.1 mg/kg sc (3 - 6mg) may be administered. The cat is less sensitive to apomorphine than the dog and the high dose rates recommended make its application to this species unsuitable. Apomorphine should not be used in cases of severe CNS depression or when the animal is seizuring. Some of the undesirable signs produced by apomorphine may be controlled afterwards by the iv administration of an opioid antagonist (e.g. naloxone (Narcan) 0.04mg/kg).</p>
					<p>Alternative emetics are xylazine (cat 1 mg/kg (0.05 mL/kg of 2% solution sc or im) and morphine (0.1mg/kg). Neither of these are 100% effective. Dogs are less responsive to xylazine, although a dose of 1 - 3 mg/kg (0.05 0.15mL/kg sc or im) may be tried. These doses will cause severe CNS and cardiovascular depression in both species. Yohimbine (0.1 mg/kg iv) or atipamezole (125&micro;g/kg dog, 250&micro;g/kg cat, im or sc ) can be used to reverse the effects of xylazine.</p>
					<p>Following forced emesis ensure that the animal does not inhale its vomitus as this may lead to the development of an aspiration pneumonia. Induced vomition is contraindicated in cases of poisoning by barbiturates, kerosene, and corrosive substances.</p>

					<p>This may be used to remove ingested poison if the animal is either comatose or has been anaesthetised. Gastric lavage is effective for 1 - 2 hours after ingestion of a poison. Firstly insert an endotracheal tube and inflate the cuff; next insert the gastric tube, using one with as large a diameter as possible and by the use of suction or gravity drain as much of the gastric contents off as possible. The patient's head should be kept lowered slightly during the procedure. Take great care when inserting the stomach tube as penetration of the oesophagus or stomach wall may occur if they have been damaged by the poison.</p>
					<p>100 - 200mL of warm tap water (about 10 mL/kg) should be instilled repeatedly and drained off until all the stomach content has been removed and the lavage fluid is clear. Activated charcoal (5 - 10 mL/kg of 1g/5mL water) can be used in the final flushings. Cattle should receive 1 kg/500kg of body weight. The constipating effect of activated charcoal should be countered by using sorbitol (1 - 4 g/kg) or other laxative with the first dose of activated charcoal (Table 7). Repeated doses of laxatives are contraindicated.</p>

					<p>It is impossible to wash out the stomachs of large animals and ruminants.The only effective method of emptying the stomach in ruminants is by rumenotomy.If the ruminal contents are removed it is essential that they are replaced by suitable sloppy material. A good mixture is chaff mixed with bran and well crushed oats, scalded with boiling water but brought back to body temperature before dosing. Re
establishment of the bacterial flora in the rumen is ensured by dosing with one or two cuds from a healthy animal.</p>

					<p>Following forced vomiting or gastric lavage a further decontamination should be given. Universal antidotes containing activated charcoal, magnesium oxide, kaolin and tannic acid are no longer considered therapeutically valid. Activated charcoal binds to part of the magnesium oxide and tannic acid diminishing its adsorptive properties. Administered alone, activated charcoal (1 - 4 g/kg) and kaolin (15 g/kg) will adsorb most poisons, while tannic acid will precipitate any alkaloid or heavy metal which may remain in the stomach. Tannates which are formed are insoluble. Light magnesium oxide neutralises acids and has a laxative effect.</p>
					<p>Catechu, a powerful astringent plant extract, is found in antidiarrhoeal remedies.</p>
					<p>Activated charcoal is a finely divided, black powder that is sparingly soluble in water. It is prepared by pyrolysis of organic matter. The charcoal is activated by exposing it to oxidation with steam or oxygen at temperatures over 600&#x02DA;C. Activated charcoal has a very large surface area. It will adsorb materials from water and air if mixed in water and allowed to stand. It adsorbs many but not all poisons (see Table 8).</p>

					<p>An anion exchange compound used to bind toxins is cholestyramine resin (Questran). Cholestyramine binds lipoproteins and bile acids thus preventing intestinal absorption that occurs via these systems. Cholestyramine can interrupt the enterohepatic recirculation of compounds excreted via the bile. Examples of compounds that the resin will bind with are phenobarbitone, propranolol, tetracycline, penicillin G, digoxin, thyroxin, phenylbutazone, some pesticides, any highly lipophilic compound, heat stable <i>Escherichia coli </i>enterotoxin and warfarin. The recommended dosage for animals is 50 - 75 mg/kg po. Fluid therapy may be required as hydration status is important when cholestyramine resin is used. Questran contains 4 gr cholestyramine with aspartame and orange flavouring to be mixed with water, milk or fruit juice.</p>
					<p>The potential side effects of cholestyramine are nausea, hypoproteinaemia, constipation, steatorrhoea and the loss of fat
soluble vitamins. In humans the reported side effects include irritation to the tongue and perianal area, muscle and joint pain, headache and dizziness.</p>

					<p><b>Cathartics</b></p>
					<p>The cathartic should be administered by stomach tube, following gastric lavage. Sodium sulphate is preferred to magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) particularly when mixed with activated charcoal. The use of magnesium sulphate may produce depression of the central nervous system and release of toxin from charcoal is less likely when sodium sulphate is used. Liquid paraffin (mineral oil) is useful if lipid soluble toxicants are involved. It is inert and unlikely to be absorbed whereas vegetable oils are readily absorbed and are therefore contraindicated. Oil should be followed by a saline cathartic given 30 minutes afterwards. (See Table 7).</p>

					<p>Absorbed toxicants are generally excreted via the kidneys, although other routes such as bile, faeces, lung and other body secretions may be involved.</p>
					<p>The urinary excretion of toxicants may be enhanced by the use of diuretics or by altering the pH of the urine. The use of diuretics to enhance urinary excretion of toxicants requires adequate renal function and hydration of the affected animal.Monitoring urine output is essential. The diuretics of choice are mannitol (2g/kg/hour) and frusemide (5mg/kg every 6 - 8 hours). Alteration of the urinary pH to increase the excretion of toxicants is a common technique and relies on the fact that ionised compounds do not readily cross cell membranes, and therefore are not reabsorbed. Generally speaking, acidic compounds (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid) and some barbiturates are largely ionised in alkaline urine and alkaline compounds tend to remain ionised in acidic urine.</p>
					<p>Agents which acidify urine include ammonium chloride (200 mg/kg/day in divided doses) and ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (Chlorethamine 1 to 2 tablets given three times daily, for an averaged sized dog). Sodium bicarbonate may be used as an alkalinising agent; in an emergency give 1 - 2 mEq/kg iv.</p>

A chelator may bind to several other metals in the body such as calcium resulting in a hypocalcaemia (e.g. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) There is no ideal chelator. Each chelator has side effects, contraindications and precautions for use.

					<p class="caption">* Depends on the form of mercury, chronicity and renal function. See the chapter on mercury.</p>
					<p>British antilewisite (BAL) was designed during world war 1 to bind to arsenical gas but will also chelate lead. BAL is useful to treat acute or chronic poisoning by organic and inorganic arsenicals and protects against mercury
induced renal injury. For mercury it is not considered effective unless given prior to the onset of clinical signs. It is not recommended for cadmium toxicity as it may enhance renal damage due to partial dissociation in the urine. BAL is not recommended for iron or selenium poisoning. Toxic side effects of BAL use include nephrotoxicity, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, lacrimation, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, paresthesias, restlessness, tremors, coma and death. Injections are painful.</p>
					<p>Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3
dimercapto
1
propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) are water
soluble analogues of dimercaprol (BAL). Compared to BAL, DMSA and DMPS are less toxic and effective when given orally. Adverse effects caused by DMPS in dogs include muscle tremors, tachycardia, dyspnoea, vomiting and defaecation. DMSA and DMPS will chelate arsenic, copper, lead and mercury.</p>
					<p>Calcium disodium edetate (CaEDTA), also known as calcium disodium versenate, will chelate metals that have a higher binding affinity than calcium<sup>2+</sup>, e.g. lead, iron, nickel, zinc, manganese, beryllium and copper. CaEDTA is used to prevent binding with calcium resulting in hypocalcaemia.CaEDTA does not readily penetrate cells but complexes with circulating metal ions. It is not recommended for oral use as it may chelate dietary metals and aid absorption. Toxicity of EDTA limits its usefulness. EDTA may cause severe proximal nephron degeneration. Other effects reported include vomiting and diarrhoea (dogs), fever, dermatitis and nasal congestion.</p>
					<p>Penicillamine is obtained by the hydrolysis of penicillin, and only the D
isomer is recommended for use. It is given orally and is well absorbed. It effectively chelates copper, iron, mercury, zinc and lead and promotes their excretion in the urine.The drug is used for copper storage
associated hepatopathies in dogs and lead poisoning. Vomiting is a common adverse effect.</p>
					<p>Desferrioxamine mesylate (Desferal) is a good chelating agent for iron toxicity. The drug is given iv or im. Desferrioxamine is toxic and should not be used unless the severity of the iron toxicity warrants its use. Potential problems associated with human use are allergic reactions, pain at the injection site and gastrointestinal distress.</p>
