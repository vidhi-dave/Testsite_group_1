					<p>Intoxication caused by metabolites produced by members of the <i>Claviceps</i> genus is the oldest known mycotoxicosis.&nbsp; The species involved are <i>C. purpurea</i>, the ergot of rye and other grain crops and grasses, and <i>C. paspali</i>, the ergot of <i>Paspalum spp.</i>&nbsp; As a result of fungus infection of the seed head the ovary is destroyed and replaced by a compacted mass of hyphae known as a sclerotium.&nbsp; This projects from the ear as a small, dark, horn like or rounded structure.&nbsp; Grazing stock become affected when they consume pasture heavily infested with this stage of the parasite.</p>

						<p>The main alkaloids of ergot are amides and polypeptide derivatives of lysergic and isolysergic acids, known as ergotamine, ergometrine and ergotoxine.&nbsp; Ergotamine&nbsp;stimulates and then depresses the central nervous system, but its main action is a stimulant effect on constrictor adrenergic nerves supplying arteriolar smooth musculature and on uterine musculature.&nbsp; It is also a powerful blocker of alpha adrenergic receptors.&nbsp; Ergometrine&nbsp;and ergotoxine&nbsp;are similar in their effects except that they do not stimulate sympathetic nerve endings so strongly, if at all.&nbsp; Together with constrictor activity, capillary damage leads to thrombosis of arterioles, vascular stasis, ischaemia and gangrene of the affected part the so called gangrenous ergotism.&nbsp; Crude ergots may also be irritant to the alimentary tract, causing diarrhoea.</p>
						<p>Convulsive ergotism (paspalum staggers) resembles tetanus and occurs rapidly in animals when the daily intake of toxin in affected pasture is substantially higher.&nbsp; The toxins producing paspalum staggers has been identified as tremorgens of toxic <i>Paspalum dilatatum</i> known as paspalinines.&nbsp; These have similar properties to the tremorgens which produce ryegrass staggers.</p>

						<p>The clinical signs of gangrenous ergotism are similar to those of <a href="fescu.html">fescue toxicity</a>.&nbsp; However it is believed that ergotism characterised by neurological signs, namely ataxia and tremors, is the more common disease.</p>
						<p>The disease is similar in all species, requiring several kilograms of seed heads containing sclerotia, consumed over 2 6 days for animals to become affected.</p>
						<p>Initially animals become nervous and hypersensitive.&nbsp; This is followed by tremors of the muscles of the limbs and body, seen particularly after exercise.&nbsp; This may become so severe that animals are unable to feed.&nbsp; There is marked incoordination of gait with swaying hindquarters, staggering and difficulty in posturing.&nbsp; Excess salivation and a rapid heart rate are also features.</p>
						<p>Animals will recover if removed from affected pasture carefully.&nbsp; In this respect the condition is very similar to perennial <a href="lolitrem.html">ryegrass staggers</a>.</p>

					<p>Treatment of affected animals involves removing them from toxic paddocks where ergotised seedheads are present, to safe paddocks where the pasture is non toxic and the risk of misadventure is minimal.&nbsp; Animals should be moved as gently as possible and where possible left undisturbed until recovered.</p>

					<p>The disease may be prevented by restricting access to ergotised paspalum or other ergotised grasses.&nbsp; Animals can be protected by making sure that the inflorescence is not allowed to remain standing long enough for the sclerotia to develop.&nbsp; Paddocks with ergotised seedheads can be made safer by topping the pasture to remove the heads.</p>
