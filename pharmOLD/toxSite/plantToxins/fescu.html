					<p>Fescue foot or tall fescue lameness of cattle has been reported in NZ, Australia and North America for many years.&nbsp; Its occurrence has been most prevalent in the autumn and winter period and it has been reported in both cattle and sheep grazing tall fescue, <i>Festuca arundinacea</i>.</p>

					<p>The disease is now known more correctly as fescue toxicity and it is caused by ergot alkaloids produced by the fescue endophyte (<i>Neotyphodium coenophialum</i>).</p>
					<p>The fescue endophyte, as with the ryegrass endophyte, is a good example of mutualism.&nbsp; The plants offers the fungus a substrate, protection and a means of dispersal via the seed.&nbsp; In return, the fungus offers the fescue resistance to insect attack and protection from overgrazing by herbivores.</p>
					<p>Many features of fescue endophyte infection, its mode of spread and toxin production are similar to those of the <a href="lolitrem.html">ryegrass endophyte</a>.&nbsp; These include the location of the endophyte in the plant, its transmission by seed and the effect of storage time on the viability of the fungus in the fescue seed. Vasoconstrictive peptide and clavine ergot alkaloids have been demonstrated in the aerial portions of tall fescue grass.&nbsp; Higher concentrations were found in the sheath than the leaf.&nbsp; In particular, the more active vasoconstrictive compound ergovaline was found to be the most common peptide present. Drought and high nitrogen levels in the soil increase the risk of poisoning.</p>
					<p>Cultivated tall fescue in NZ is eithere endophyte free or contains a &quot;safe&quot; endophyte. problems only arise with wild tall fescue.</p>
					<p>In the USA it is now confirmed that ergovaline&nbsp;is the vasoconstrictor causing fescue foot. Assay techniques for the toxin have been developed. These have proved useful in feed safety assays and dilution ratios to enable the safe use of endophyte infected feed for livestock.</p>

					<p><b>Fescue lameness</b></p>
					<p>Signs may appear within 10 to 14 days after animals begin grazing tall fescue and new cases may appear for up to a week after animals have been removed from affected pasture.</p>
					<p>Animals show severe lameness with the hindlimbs in particular being affected, but all four legs may become involved.&nbsp; Animals lose weight and initially there is a drying of the skin near the hoof.&nbsp; Moist gangrene with loss of hair or wool of the lower extremities takes place.&nbsp; In some cases the lower limb will actually drop off.&nbsp; Radiographs of affected limbs show a complete cessation of blood circulation.&nbsp; In severe cases, the tips of the tail and the ears of cattle may also be affected.</p>
					<p><b>Summer hyperthermia</b></p>
					<p>This is now recognised as a serious disease of cattle in New Zealand.&nbsp; In 1985 it was estimated to have occurred in 445 North Auckland dairy herds.</p>
					<p>It is characterised by a rough coat and the animal develops a rapid panting respiration, with protrusion of the tongue and excessive salivation.&nbsp; Affected cattle seek shade, hilltop breezes and will stand in water in an effort to reduce the high body temperature.&nbsp; Milk production is reduced.</p>
					<p>In Australia hyperthermia in cattle grazing annual ryegrass has been reported <b>(see Annual ryegrass toxicity).</b> The syndrome of hyperthermia appeared identical to summer hyperthermia. The ryegrass was heavily contaminated with <i>Claviceps purpurea.</i></p>
					<p><b>Infertility</b>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Ergovaline found in endophyte infected pastures has been shown to decrease ewe live weight, ovulation rates,&nbsp; number of fetuses at 90 days of pregnancy and serum prolactin levels.</p>
					<p><b>Growth rates</b></p>
					<p>Average daily weight gain in beef steers decreased by 0.45 kg/day for each 10% increase in infestation of endophyte on the pasture.</p>
					<p><b>Equine Fescue Toxicity</b></p>
					<p>Pregnant mares that ingest fescue containing ergovaline have prolonged gestation, dystocia, and decreased milk production or agalactia.</p>
					<p>Two other conditions which have been associated with toxic fescue are bovine fat necrosis and agalactia in both cattle and horses.</p>
					The various vasoconstrictor compounds associated with the fescue endophyte have their most serious effect on the extremities of cattle and sheep during cooler weather, hence the higher incidence of this syndrome (fescue lameness) at these times.&nbsp; However, it is somewhat of a paradox to find that the ergot alkaloids of endophyte infected fescue are also associated with bovine hyperthermia, a summer time disease, which is not seen in sheep.&nbsp; While the bovine animal requires the dilation of peripheral vessels to dissipate heat the sheep does not.&nbsp; It relies more on the respiratory passages and the protective effect of wool to prevent overheating.&nbsp; This may explain why the sheep do not suffer &quot;summer hyperthermia&quot; in the same way that cattle do when exposed to ergots or endophyte infected fescue in the summer.

					<p>Once the signs of fescue lameness are advanced there is no treatment possible.&nbsp; Some veterinarians have reported success in treating early cases in cattle by providing shelter from cold weather and applying warmth to the affected extremities.&nbsp; Such measures however are unsatisfactory.&nbsp;</p>

					The prevention and treatment of fescue toxicity in the pregnant mare utilises domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist
					<p>The control measures for the diseases caused by endophyte infected fescue are similar to those suggested for ryegrass staggers and include the dilution of or elimination of endophyte infected pasture, the avoidance of overstocking and overgrazing of pastures and the use of other feed sources.&nbsp; When there is a choice, avoid utilizing endophyte infected fescue during the hottest and coldest times of the years.</p>
