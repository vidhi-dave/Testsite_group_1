					<p>Lupinosis is a mycotoxicosis caused by the ingestion of toxins produced by the fungus <i>Phomopsis leptostromiformis</i> which colonises dead lupin plants.&nbsp; Lupinosis has occurred throughout the world but only in Australia and in particular Western Australia has the disease assumed major importance.</p>
					<p>It is primarily a disease of sheep but natural outbreaks have been reported in cattle, goats, donkeys, horses and pigs.</p>

					<p>The fungus will grow in a variety of lupins but in Western Australia is commonly found in the wild bitter (high alkaloid) lupin <i>Lupinos cosentinii</i> and the commercial sweet (low alkaloid) narrow leafed lupin <i><a href="../poisonplants/data/blue_lupin/blu-lupin.html">Lupinus angustifolius</a></i>.&nbsp; In Australia both these species are used extensively as animal fodder.&nbsp; The fungus <i>P. leptostromiformis </i>resides mainly in the courser lateral stems of the plant and in the dead plant most of the toxin is found in these parts.&nbsp; The fungus only appears to produce toxin after the plant dies, which explains the occurrence of the disease in summer and autumn.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>There are two forms of <i>P. leptostromiformis</i> which are referred to as Biotypes A &amp; B and only strains of Biotype A are toxigenic.&nbsp; Temperature, humidity, dew and cloud cover are factors which influence the production of toxins by <i>P. leptostromiformis</i>.&nbsp; Twenty
five degrees celsius has been reported as the optimum temperature for toxin production.</p>
					<p>Once toxicity develops in lupin stubbles it may remain for several months or even years, but generally the most toxic period is the end of summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

					<p>The toxin causes severe liver damage and the poisoning of sheep depends on a number of factors.&nbsp; Some sheep will eat more stem material than others and are therefore more prone to the effects of the toxin.&nbsp; Hungry sheep are likewise more at risk of poisoning.

					<p>The characteristic clinical signs of lupinosis are inappetance, loss of condition, lethargy and jaundice.&nbsp; Death is a common sequel and animals are usually very depressed in the terminal stages of the disease.
					<p><b>Acute lupinosis</b> results from a large intake of toxin over a short period.&nbsp; It occurs when lupin stubbles are very toxic, and affected sheep may be noticed within 2 days of introduction to the lupins.&nbsp; A large proportion of the flock may be affected and many will die, with deaths most often occurring from 3 to 4 days after introduction to the stubbles.</p>
					<p><b>Chronic lupinosis</b> results from repeated intakes of small quantities of toxin over a period of time.&nbsp; Stubbles involved either have a low level of toxicity, or a moderate level of toxicity but contain considerable alternative feed.&nbsp; Variable proportions of the flock will be affected and these animals will have differing degrees of inappetance and loss of condition.&nbsp; High water content in the rumen, lethargy, weakness and jaundice are features of this condition.&nbsp; Mortality rates tend to be low.</p>
					<p><b>Subacute lupinosis</b> is a mixture of the clinical signs described above and is the form most frequently seen in Western Australia.</p>
					<p>In affected flocks deaths may continue for up to 2 months following removal from the lupins.&nbsp; Many sheep will die of starvation but secondary infections, parasitism and myopathy may develop in weakened animals.</p>
					<p><a href="photosens.html">Photosensitisation</a> may occur as a result of liver damage but is not commonly seen in Western Australia because of lack of green feed.</p>
					<p>Two additional conditions which are sequelae to subacute lupinosis are lupinosis
associated myopathy and hyperammonaemia.&nbsp; The former condition affects the skeletal muscles and the latter condition causes degenerate changes in the central nervous system.&nbsp; This will result in a variety of postures including &quot;star gazing&quot;, head pressing, eye rolling and general incoordination.&nbsp; Abortion in late pregnancy and death of lambs are also features of the disease.</p>

					<p>The gross pathology is variable depending on either the acute or chronic nature of the disease.</p>
					<p>In acute and uncomplicated subacute lupinosis there is generalised jaundice and the liver is greatly swollen.&nbsp; It is bright yellow or orange in colour and the cut surface is very greasy.&nbsp; There is often ascites and oedema of connective tissues.&nbsp; The caecum is frequently distended with dry, hard, faecal material.&nbsp; Evidence of myopathy may been seen as obvious areas of pallor, or a very subtle pale streaking in skeletal and cardiac muscles.</p>
					<p>In chronic lupinosis, jaundice is frequently not a feature.&nbsp; The liver is small, hard, copper or tan in colour and often misshapen.&nbsp; The rumen contents are very watery and the abomasum and small intestine contain very little solid matter.&nbsp; The caecum may contain hard, dry impacted faecal material.&nbsp; Ascites may be present and there may be evidence of general muscle wastage.</p>

					<p>The primary aim of treatment is to stimulate appetite in the affected animals.&nbsp; The entire flock should be removed from lupin stubbles and any sheep which will not recover should be destroyed.&nbsp; With the remainder of the flock it is better to divide them into affected and non
affected sheep.&nbsp; The latter should be moved as little as possible and placed on a supplementary feeding diet of grain, lucerne hay or other good quality feed.&nbsp; Spraying hay with molasses, or butyric acid or aniseed essence may attract anorexic sheep to eat.&nbsp; Supplementary feeding may have to continue for some time.&nbsp; It is unwise to feed high protein supplements or urea.</p>
					<p> Lupinosis may result in an increase in liver copper and a reduction in liver zinc levels.&nbsp; The high copper levels may predispose to <a href="../toxins/Cu.html">copper toxicosis</a>, while the low zinc levels may depress the sheeps' appetite.&nbsp; Treatment with zinc will correct the zinc deficiency and cause displacement of copper from the liver.&nbsp; However caution should be used in <a href="../toxins/ZnTher.html">zinc dosing</a>; the regime to be followed is similar to that described for facial eczema.&nbsp; If copper toxicosis is a problem molybdenum and ammonium sulphate treatment as described under copper poisoning may be used.</p>
					<p>Attention to parasite control, and cobalt deficiency if it occurs are both important aspects of nursing affected sheep back to health.</p>

					<p>Obviously prevention of lupinosis is the aim of graziers using lupin as a major source of stock fodder.&nbsp; The following are recommended practices fundamental to the prevention of lupinosis.</p>
					<p>Lupins should be grazed soon after harvest (i.e. in early summer).&nbsp; The longer grazing is delayed, the greater the chance that dangerous levels of toxicity will develop.&nbsp; Stocking rates should be kept low to avoid close grazing and ample water should be available to stock at all times.&nbsp; It is also not advisable to graze hungry sheep or pregnant ewes on lupin stubble.</p>
					<p>Introducing sheep, particularly weaners to lupin seed before they are allowed to graze lupin stubble is sound practice and sheep should not be left on lupin stubble after most of the seed has been consumed.</p>
					<p>Close inspection of flocks grazing lupin stubble is most important, particularly after rain. Even a day's delay in moving sheep at risk can be vital in preventing disease.</p>
					<p>
						<p>In making lupin hay, the stage of cutting and the rapidity of drying are important factors for preventing the storage of high levels of <i>P. leptostromiformis</i>.&nbsp; Another aspect of this disease and its prevention which is being studied is the production of fungus resistant lupins.&nbsp; A number of promising crossbred lines of <i>L. angustifolius </i>have been identified and these show a greater degree of resistance than the currently available cultivars of <i>L. albus</i>.</p>
