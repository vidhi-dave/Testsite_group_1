					<p>Mercury poisoning may arise in one of three ways. These include poisoning by metallic mercury and its inorganic salts; the poisoning by organic mercurial compounds and the toxic effects of mercury when it enters the food chain and is ingested by eating the flesh of contaminated fish and food animals.</p>
					<p>All species can be affected and mercury poisoning has been reported in sheep, pigs, cats and dogs in New Zealand.&nbsp; Its occurrence is rare since most mercurial medications and seed dressings have been discontinued.</p>

					<p class="sgH3">Inorganic mercury&nbsp;compounds</p>
					<p>Metallic mercury was used as a constituent of purgative powders, various parasiticides and counter
irritant ointments (blisters). They included yellow mercuric oxide (HgO) used almost exclusively in eye ointments, red mercuric iodide (HgI<sub>2</sub>) and mercuric nitrate (Hg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 2H<sub>2</sub>O) also used in ointments.&nbsp; Mercuric iodide (red iodide of mercury) was used as a counter
irritant for horses for the treatment of sprained tendons. Mercuric chloride tablets were used as a bacteriostat but were ineffective in the presence of protein and sulphur containing compounds.&nbsp; Mercurous chloride (Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) or calomel was an archaic laxative.&nbsp; Poisonings have occurred when mercuric chloride was used in its place.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Organic Mercurial Compounds</p>
					<p>The organic mercurial compounds are less irritant and less toxic than inorganic mercury.&nbsp; They can be divided into two groups.</p>
					<p><b>Antiseptics and diuretics</b></p>
					<p>This group included such products as mercurochrome, methiolate and mersalyl, the latter being a diuretic.&nbsp; These are used very little nowadays.</p>
					<p><b>Fungicides and seed dressings</b></p>
					<p>This group included phenylmercuric chloride, phenylmercuric acetate, methylmercuric acetate
chloride&nbsp;and others.&nbsp; These latter products were responsible for some very tragic poisoning of humans when grain that had been treated with these materials was sold for human consumption.</p>
					<p>Mercury is cycled freely in various forms between the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere of the earth.&nbsp; It is found in most rocks and soils at an average concentration of 50 ppb (fifty parts per billion), although some soils, particularly in England and Northern Ireland, contain higher residues.&nbsp; Mercury is also found in fossil fuels, ranging from concentrations of 20 ppm for petroleum oils to 300 ppm for anthracite coal and 500 ppm for tars.&nbsp; Mercury volatilises spontaneously into the atmosphere.&nbsp; At higher elevations and lower ambient temperatures, mercury is returned to the earth by rain.&nbsp; Rain and oceans are estimated to contain approximately 0.2 ppb and inland waters less than 0.1 ppb.&nbsp; This mercury cycle has a turnover cycle of about 2 years.</p>
					<p>Anaerobic and <i>aerobic</i> bacteria (<i>methanorgani</i>c bacteria), which are found in the mud of lakes and rivers and on the ocean floor, convert inorganic and aromatic mercury into methyl mercury.&nbsp; This compound is soluble in water and accumulates in high concentrations in carnivorous fish and aquatic mammals.&nbsp; In any locality the larger, older fish are likely to have higher methyl mercury levels.&nbsp; However where water contamination is high, the small fish may also have high levels.</p>
					<p>Mercury accumulates through the food chain and animals and humans consuming fish containing high levels of methyl mercury may themselves become intoxicated.&nbsp; Already a number of people in the world have been poisoned this way.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Mercury residues in the tissues of domestic pigs and feral animals.</p>
					<p>In New Zealand and other countries, a highly significant association exists between fishmeal in the diets of domestic pigs and mercury residues in pig meat and offal tissues. As a result the New Zealand Pork Industry has been strongly advised to avoid feeding fishmeal to pigs. Also overseas data suggests that is some countries environmental mercury contamination of feral animals is a significant problem. In New Zealand high total mercury levels also exist in the tissues of feral pigs and appear to be derived from unavoidable environmental contamination. As a result livers and kidneys of all feral pig carcasses submitted for processing in Game Packing Houses are condemned as unfit for human consumption. It is also recommended that feral pig meat not be eaten more than once a week. Total mercury residues in tissues of feral red deer are of no risk to public health.</p>
					<p>Methyl mercury&nbsp;(MeHg) is the compound of toxicological concern. Mercury is ubiquitous in the environment. Residues of mercury occur in the oceans as a result of leaching and volatilisation. These are converted by microorganisms in sea sediment to MeHg.</p>

					<p>Inorganic mercury and methyl mercury are extremely toxic, the latter through its cumulative effects.&nbsp; The organic mercury compounds, now largely disused are relatively less toxic.</p>
					<p>Inorganic mercurial salts cause direct tissue necrosis and renal tubular necrosis. The mercuric ion binds to sulphur and inhibits sulphydryl
containing enzymes in the microsomes and mitochondria. Protein binding also occurs. Organic alkyl mercurials interfer with metabolic activity and prevent synthesis of essential proteins, leading to cell breakdown and necrosis, particularly in the brain.</p>

					<p>Inorganic mercury is lipid soluble and can be absorbed by inhalation. Mercury vapour is extremely toxic to sheep and cattle and is presumably absorbed via the respiratory tract.&nbsp; Ingested inorganic mercury and mercurial salts are absorbed very slowly from the gastrointestinal tract. Finely divided metallic mercury and mercury compounds are readily absorbed even through the intact skin.&nbsp; Dogs and cats are particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of mercury from ointments due to their licking habits.&nbsp; Cattle have also been poisoned in this manner. Inorganic mercury are transported in erythrocytes and plasma with bioaccumulation in the renal cortex.</p>
					<p>Organic methyl and ethyl mercury compounds are lipophilic and highly absorbed when ingested. These compounds bind initially to erythrocytes and eventually bioaccumulate in the brain and to a lesser degree in kidney and muscle.&nbsp; They are the most toxic forms of mercury. Organic mercury tends to be excreted via the bile and faeces, less than 10% is found in the urine. Methyl mercury has a half
life of 70 days and 44 days in cats and humans, respectively.</p>
					<p>In general, absorbed mercury is eliminated very slowly and considerable amounts may be retained in tissues indefinitely.&nbsp; When released it is mainly excreted in urine, but some is excreted in saliva, sweat, milk and faeces.</p>

					<p>Early signs are erythema of the skin, conjunctivitis, lacrimation and stomatitis. Other effects may include neurological signs of depression, ataxia, incoordination, paresis and blindness.</p>
					<p>Mercurial diuretics used for long periods may cause electrolyte imbalance and pigs given mercury dressed grain have developed anorexia, ataxia, blindness and chronic gastrointestinal signs.</p>
					<p>In humans the phenomenon of mercury ptyalism develops after prolonged exposure to mercury.&nbsp; This is characterised by profuse salivation, swelling of the gums, tooth loss and jaw necrosis.</p>

					<p>In the kidney, liver and brain &gt;15 ppm of mercury is diagnostic. Over time this level declines. Experimental work with severe methyl mercury toxicity in cats reported lower concentrations in the kidney.</p>
					Microscopic changes include (alkyl mercurials) include fibrinoid degeneration of cerebral arterioles (swine and cattle), laminar necrosis and loss of myelin, and in cats cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens exposed in utero. Inhalation of mercury may produce a corrosive bronchitis and interstitial pneumonia.&nbsp; Samples for diagnosis include gut contents, liver and kidney fresh and preserved. Brain, both fixed and fresh, should be taken if organic mercurials are suspected.
					<p>&nbsp;Blood, plasma and urine analysis in live animals may be indicative, however, false negative tests of urine result due to concentration and time dependent&nbsp; elimination of mercury.</p>

					<p>In acute mercury poisoning treatment is usually hopeless.&nbsp; Unless the gut can be emptied very quickly death will follow.&nbsp; There is no specific antidote so that treatment is along general principles as for other corrosive poisons.</p>
					<p>Mercurial salts:</p>
					<p>In acute situations, egg white, activated charcoal or sodium thiosulphate (0.5
1.0 g/kg) may be beneficial in binding mercury. A laxative to promote elimination from the gastrointestinal tract is suggested. D
penicillamine (15
30mg/kg PO) may be given after all mercury is cleared from the gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Inorganic mercury poisoning responds best to DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) and to a lesser extent BAL chelation therapy. BAL is not very effective for treating chronic exposure to organic mercurials. Chelation therapy is generally not effective for organic mercury poisoning.</p>
					<p>For chronic poisoning, advise the owner that neurological damage may be permanent. Keep in mind that meat from livestock (eggs from poultry) may be a hazardous source of mercury for humans and animals.</p>
					<p>Alkyl mercurials:</p>
					<p>except that methyl mercury poisoning treated with DMSA&nbsp; will increase the excretion of mercury</p>
					<p>Alkyl mercurials can accumulate in edible organs and muscle. Mercury intoxicated animals should never be used for food.</p>
