					<p>The main timber preservative used out of doors in New Zealand is copper 
 chrome 
 <a href="arsenic.html">arsenic</a>.&nbsp; Other wood preservatives such as <a href="#5clPhen">pentachlorophenol</a> and <a href="disinf.html#boron">borate</a> are only used for the treatment of timber to be used indoors and therefore are an unlikely stock hazard.&nbsp; <a href="#clNap">Chlorinated naphthalene</a> is now no longer used as a wood preservative, but its persistence in old timber it is still potentially a source of poisoning to animals.&nbsp; In the past it was responsible for the loss of and wasting in cattle in NZ so that brief reference to it is warranted. Creosote is rarely seen these days: it is similar to other <a href="disinf.html#phenol">phenolic</a> toxins.</p>

					<p>The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1941 and because of its unknown aetiology it was called X disease.&nbsp; Latterly it was referred to as hyperkeratosis X.&nbsp; Subsequently it was found to be caused by one of the chlorinated naphthalene derivatives.&nbsp; The higher chlorinated analogues, pentachloronaphthalene and hexachloronaphthalene&nbsp;were mainly responsible for the cause of this widespread chloracneiform dermatosis and other lesions in cattle.</p>
					<p>In NZ poisoning of cattle has been reported but all domestic animals are susceptible.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Sources</p>
					<p>Pentachloronaphthalene&nbsp;is particularly persistent in treated timber and once thoroughly treated, timber will resist invasion by termites and other wood boring insects, for many years.&nbsp; Very small amounts of the material may be detrimental to stock health.&nbsp; While the main source of chlorinated naphthalenes is in preserved timber it is also found in lubricating oils, floor varnishes, ceramics, electrical insulators and solvents.</p>
					<p>In NZ and Australia poisoning in cattle has been associated with environmental sump oil contamination and hay contaminated by chlorinated naphthalene </p>
					<p class="titleTox">Toxicity and pathogenesis</p>
					<p>There are similarities between the hyperkeratosis produced by chlorinated naphthalenes and that produced by vitamin A deficiency.&nbsp; Experimentally it has been found that plasma vitamin A levels decrease rapidly after feeding with a hyperkeratogenic agent and if carotene is administered at this time plasma carotene levels increase but plasma vitamin A does not.&nbsp; Therefore it has been postulated that chlorinated naphthalenes interfere with the conversion of carotene into vitamin A.</p>
					<p>A dose as small as 11
22 mg/kg of chlorinated naphthalene has produced symptoms in calves.&nbsp; In practice, poisoning is usually due to continued ingestion of small amounts of the substances over a period of time.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Clinical signs</p>
					<p>The disease is often not particularly noticed until the skin lesions appear.</p>
					<p>In cattle clinical signs include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>listlessness and depression
						<li>variable appetite (pica 
 pizzle sucking in calves)<li>lachrymation and nasal discharge
						<li>drooling of saliva
						<li>red swollen areas in mouth and on muzzle
						<li>polyuria
						<li>loss of weight
						<li>abortion in pregnant animals
						<li>finally after 6
8 weeks the characteristic lesion of thickening and wrinkling of the skin develops (this is caused by a gradual accumulation of hard, keratinous material;&nbsp; the folds cannot be reduced by stretching the skin).&nbsp; The lesions are usually confined to the neck and withers but in extreme cases may cover the body.</ul>
					<p>Sheep do not show the skin lesions nor the excessive fall in plasma Vitamin A.&nbsp; There is weakness, loss of weight, loss of appetite, nasal discharge and ascites.&nbsp; Pigs do not show the characteristic lesions as seen in cattle.&nbsp; In kittens and dogs, lachrymation, conjunctivitis and general depression have been observed.&nbsp; Loss of hair is recorded in cats and dogs exposed to the vapour of wood preservatives.</p>
					<p>The external application of chlorinated naphthalenes gives rise to typical skin lesions but prolonged application is needed before internal changes are seen.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Differential diagnosis</p>
					<p>Dermatophilosis, photosensitization and vitamin A deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Post mortem</p>
					<p>Pathological changes include hyperkeratosis of the skin and hair follicles.&nbsp; In the oral cavity the papillary proliferations consist of irregular, thickened epithelium supported by strands of subepithelial connective tissue.&nbsp; Similar lesions are formed on the oesophageal mucosa and sometimes in the forestomachs.&nbsp; There are also nodular proliferative lesions affecting the mucosa of the large bile ducts and gall bladder, and ductular hyperplasia and portal fibrosis are sometimes present.&nbsp; The kidneys are enlarged and pale and microscopically there is tubular degeneration and dilatation with extensive interstitial fibrosis.</p>
					<p>In cattle, lesions of the reproductive tract are reported including, squamous metaplasia of the accessory sex glands and excretory ducts of the testes in the bull.&nbsp; In cows, metaplasia of the cervix and Gartner's ducts are reported.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Treatment</p>
					<p>There is no effective treatment.</p>

					<p>Pentachlorophenol is a crystalline chemical similar to other phenols.&nbsp; It has been used as pesticide, bactericide, fungicide, molluscicide and insecticide.&nbsp; Its main current use is as a timber preservative.</p>
					<p>Sheep, cattle, poultry and cats have been affected.</p>
					<p class="titleTox">Pathogenesis and clinical signs</p>
					<p><span class="dynamic-style-3">
					Like the other substituted <a href="DNPs.html">phenols</a> it is a powerful uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and this is the cause of death in acute poisoning.&nbsp; The clinical features and pathological findings in PCP toxicity especially subacute or chronic toxicity, appear to be highly species dependent.&nbsp; Most features of poisoning are as for other phenols.&nbsp; Sodium pentachlorophenate ingested by poultry was the cause of chronic liver disease in poultry and was characterised by biliary cirrhosis.
