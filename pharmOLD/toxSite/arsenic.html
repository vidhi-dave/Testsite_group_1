					<p>Arsenic was once a very common cause of poisoning in farm animals and pets in NZ. In recent years the incidence has declined due to the marked reduction in the use of arsenical compounds, the banning of arsenical sheep dips, and the replacement of arsenical orchard sprays, herbicides and other pesticides with more effective materials. Nevertheless arsenic has been a constant source of poisoning to both humans and domestic animals. Arsenic leaching into ground water from copper-chrome-arsenic treated fenceposts is currently causing concern.</p>

						<p>Arsenic exists in two forms; grey or metallic arsenic which is very stable and a metalloid form or yellow arsenic. Metallic arsenic exists in three oxidative states; elementary, trivalent (arsenite) and pentavalent (arsenate). Arsenical compounds are widely distributed in nature and can be found in soils and ores mainly as sulphides.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Natural Sources</p>
						<p>Natural sources of arsenic are arsenical pyrites (FeS2 FeAs2), the sulphates, realgar (As2S3) and orpiment (As2S3). Soils in the thermal regions of New Zealand have particularly high arsenical concentrations, and mud from the Waiotapu valley has been shown to contain as much as 2% of arsenic. Disturbances to the top layer of these soils, as in post hole digging, may allow puddles of water to accumulate in the underlying soil layers which contain toxic levels of arsenic.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Industrial Sources</p>
						<p>During the roasting of metallic ores as well as in the production of arsenic, arsenic trioxide is produced and may be carried as a dust to contaminate soil, herbage and water.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Arsenic Trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</p>
						<p>Arsenic trioxide is the most commonly used arsenical compound and being an amorphous or crystalline, white, tasteless powder its resemblance to flour and chalk has lead to many fatal poisonings. It was once used in New Zealand as a rabbit and rat poison but its main use now is as a hide dressing, which contains 50% W/V of As2O3 (Trade name Peltex).</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Arsenic in Tanalised Timber</p>
						<p>Timber can be preserved by soaking it for over 4 - 6 weeks in arsenical salts (eg copper chrome arsenic) or an arsenic oxide which are then fixed in the wood in a relatively insoluble form. A green powder (copper chrome arsenic) may be left in the posts and battens that may contain up to 5% of arsenic. The arsenic oxide imparts a brown colour to treated wood. Animals are exposed to a very real risk if they lick freshly tanalised wood. A weathering period of at least four weeks is considered necessary to reduce the risk to grazing animals.</p>
						<p>Even seasoned timber may be dangerous and cases of poisoning are reported of possums housed in boxes made from tanalised timber. Dogs housed in kennels made from tanalised wood may develop contact dermatitis and arsenic poisoning. Horses have also been poisoned from crib biting tanalised rails and the loss of deer in recently constructed compounds has also been recorded in NZ.</p>
						<p>The ash from tanalised timber after it is burnt may contain concentrations of arsenic up to 3%. Deaths from the ingestion of this have occurred in cattle.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Arsenic in Sheep Dips</p>
						<p>Arsenical dips were once a very common cause of poisoning of both sheep and cattle, but arsenical poisoning from this source is now rare due to the ban on their use. Arsenical sheep and cattle dips were usually combined with sulphur and contained 20% soluble arsenic and 3% insoluble arsenious sulphide. When diluted for use the soluble arsenic concentration was between 0.25% and 0.5%. Poisoning (of cattle in particular) usually resulted from stock gaining access to rusted containers of dip which frequently contained lethal residues of arsenic. Deaths from this source were reported as late as 1999.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Herbicides &amp; Grain Dr<span class="sidebarHeader">e</span>ssings</p>
						<p>Sodium and potassium arsenite (Na3AsO3 and K3AsO3) and the thioarsinites have been used as weedkillers and grain dressings. They are now banned in NZ.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Other Historical Uses of Arsenic</p>
						<p>Lead and calcium arsenates have been used as fruit tree sprays and sodium arsenate was an ingredient of some flypapers and used as an anthelmintic and for the treatment of footrot in sheep. Arsenicals were also used as medicinal ruminatinic preparations and tonics. Sodium thioarsetarsamide was used in injectable form for treating canine dirofilariasis.</p>
						<p>An historical and common form of arsenic was copper arsenite (Paris green) used as a cheap pigment for wallpapers and artificial flowers. Under the damp conditions of many Victorian homes arsine gas was released from the latter which was highly toxic to the inhabitants of houses papered with such material. Arsine gas may also be released from sewage contaminated with arsenical compounds.</p>
						<p>Arsenic has also been used in paint pigments, detergents and building materials.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Medicinal Arsenicals (Organic Arsenicals)</p>
						<p>The aromatic or organic arsenicals were developed during the search for less toxic arsenical compounds. Examples of such preparations used in New Zealand and other countries included Acetarsol (Acetylarsen), neoarsphenamine (Salvarsan) sulpharsphenamine (salpharsen). These were used for the treatment of histomoniasis in turkeys and as general tonics. Arecoline
acetarsol (Cestarsol) was used as an anthelmintic and purgative for treating tapeworm infestations in dogs and cats.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Growth Promoters and Treatment of Coccidiosis</p>
						<p>Arsanilic acid is used as a growth promoting factor in pig and poultry feeds. Three (3) nitro, 4 hydroxyphenyl arsonic acid is used for the treatment of coccidiosis in poultry. They can prove toxic at levels above those recommended. Arsanilic acid has also been used in the control of swine dysentery.</p>
						<p>The feed additive 3
nitro, 4
hydroxyphenylarsonic acid produces toxicity in swine at 250 ppm of the diet if fed for 7
10 days.</p>
						<p>Recommended levels of arsanilic acid in pig and poultry diets and the time effects of higher doses are:</p>

						<p>The absorption of arsenic compounds occurs through the alimentary tract, respiratory tract and the skin. The absorption of arsenic is continuous and unlimited. The local effect of the arsenic on tissues is usually less important than the generalised capillary and mucosal effects which occur regardless of the route.</p>
						<p>The degree of the systemic signs seen following percutaneous absorption depends upon the blood circulation within the epidermis. If there is a good local circulation then rapid absorption occurs with very little local necrosis but with the development of generalised systemic signs will take place. However, if there is exposure to a large quantity of toxic arsenate, then local oedema, necrosis and sloughing of the skin occurs. Regardless of the route of absorption, the major pathological signs are found in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
						<p>Arsenic is transported to all the body tissues, but it is the tissues with the highest concentration of oxidative enzymes, which are most susceptible to its toxic effects. These tissues include the liver, kidney, alimentary tract wall and the spleen. Arsenical compounds readily cross the placental barrier, but they don't penetrate the blood
brain barrier very well. Arsenic disappears rapidly from soft tissue, but is stored permanently in keratinised tissues e.g. hair, hoof and skin and in bone. Once arsenic is deposited in keratin it moves slowly along the hair shaft or hoof as the tissue grows.</p>

					<div class="Section1">
						<p>Factors which affect the toxicity of arsenical compounds include:</p>
						<p>a. The chemical structure of the arsenical compound is very important in determining toxicity. The trivalent forms of arsenic are up to ten times more toxic than the pentavalent forms.</p>
						<p>Soluble arsenical compounds are far more toxic than insoluble compounds. If the compound is insoluble, then the toxicity is determined by the particle size. Finely divided powders are more toxic than coarse compounds. Sodium arsenate is readily soluble and easily absorbed and so, it is more toxic than arsenic trioxide, sodium arsenate and calcium arsenate. In general, aromatic organic arsenical compounds are less toxic than the inorganic aliphatic forms of arsenic.</p>
						<p>b. Oral administration may reduce the toxicity of some compounds. The condition of the digestive organs, the nature of the ingesta and the method of application, all affect the dose of an arsenical compound that will produce toxic signs. Absorption of dips is particularly rapid through fresh skin wounds. Adult sheep can absorb up to 88mg arsenic trioxide following dipping in a normal dip solution containing 0.2% arsenic.</p>
						<p>c. The oral lethal dose of sodium arsenite in most species is 1
25 mg/kg. However, there is some species variation and it is thought that cats are the most susceptible followed by horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, swine and birds. See Table 10.</p>
						<p>Herbivores, especially cattle, are more commonly intoxicated with arsenical compounds, because of exposure to contaminated forage and farm chemicals. Cats ingest the syrupy baits intended for insects, and dogs may be poisoned either maliciously or following therapy with heartworm remedies containing arsenic.</p>
						<p>d. The condition of the individual animal is very important, as toxicity is greatly enhanced in animals which are dehydrated, debilitated, or have a degree of compromised renal or hepatic function. Some dogs infected with heartworm are particularly susceptible to intoxication with thiacetarsamide sodium. Infections in dogs of over 2
4 billion microfilaria cause depression of the major enzyme systems. These metabolic systems are then highly susceptible to inactivation by therapeutic doses of arsenic.</p>
						<p>Chronic poisoning in animals is rare, because arsenic is rapidly excreted from the body. Some authors consider that the flesh of the surviving animals is safe to eat, although the liver and viscera may remain toxic.</p>
						<p>Quantities of arsenic which are considered to be toxic to man, have been found in the milk of cows feeding on grass sprayed with an arsenical weed killer. A withholding period of forty days before slaughter has been recommended after cattle have had access to any form of inorganic arsenic.</p>

					<div class="Section1">
						<p>At a cellular level the trivalent arsenite forms strong covalent bonds with pairs of adjacent sulphydryl groups, in particular the two sulphydryl groups of lipoic acid. This yields a stable compound which inactivates the enzyme systems that rely on the availability of sulphur atoms. Disruption of these enzyme systems interferes with cellular respiration and the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates.</p>
						<p>Small blood vessels, capillaries and arterioles, are particularly affected by the toxic action of arsenic, and early on in the disease these vessels lose the ability to contract. Initially, this is reversible and contraction can be stimulated by the administration of adrenaline, indicating that the dilatation is peripherally conditioned. As the toxicosis progresses, the capillaries become dilated causing hypotensive shock and a rose red discolouration occurs in the skin of man and pigs.</p>
						<p>There is always a lag phase between exposure of the animal to the poison and the appearance of clinical signs. The clinical signs and pathological lesions are a result of the marked changes which occur within the cells, rather than any directly irritant effects of the toxin. This is supported by finding similar pathological changes in the alimentary tracts of animals poisoned either by parenteral administration or by the ingestion of an arsenical compound.</p>
						<p>Within the body, the liver partially methylates arsenates and arsenites, but it is the kidney which is the main excretory organ of arsenical compounds. Less important routes of excretion include the faeces, bile, milk, saliva and sweat. Arsenic may be detected in the urine as early as 5 - 6 hours after exposure to the poison and may persist for 7 - 14 days after a single dose and for up to 10 weeks following repeated administration of arsenical compounds.</p>
						<p>The pathogenesis of inorganic arsenate poisoning is not as completely understood as poisoning with the arsenites. Arsenate can compete with inorganic phosphate in phosphorylation reactions to form unstable arsenyl esters. Arsenate compounds also uncouple oxidative phosphorylations, presumably by competing with inorganic phosphate at one of the energy conserving steps. It has also been postulated that arsenate is reduced to arsenite before exerting its toxic effect.</p>

						<p>The clinical symptoms of arsenical poisoning vary according to the dose, physical form, route of administration and the composition (organic or inorganic) of the compound. The characteristic signs of intense gastrointestinal pain are evidence of severe damage to the digestive tract. The course of the disease is longer lasting in ruminants than in monogastrics, with symptoms appearing 20
50 hours after ingestion of the arsenical compound.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Peracute Poisoning</p>
						<p>Peracute arsenic poisoning may occur so rapidly that illness is not seen. When signs are observed they may include intense abdominal pain, staggering, collapse, paralysis and death.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Acute Poisoning</p>
						<p>In acute arsenical poisoning distress develops suddenly and the animal invariably displays a shock syndrome due to the precipitous fall in blood pressure as a result of the capillary engorgement. Usually the following signs are seen, particularly in ruminants. There is extreme thirst, animals are invariably found near to water. Salivation and vomiting (even in cattle) are seen. There is complete ruminal atony and signs of severe abdominal pain. Sometimes watery haemorrhagic diarrhoea is seen. The cardinal signs of both pulse rate and respiration rate are weak and rapid. In cattle umbilical or ventral herniae have been recorded. Death usually occurs 3 to 4 hours after the onset of clinical signs.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Subacute</p>
						<p>Poisoned animals, which have ingested a small but fatal dose of the arsenical compound, may live for 2 - 7 days. The toxicosis is manifest by depression, severe dehydration, anorexia and extreme thirst. This progresses to a haematuria, circulatory collapse, cold extremities, weak cardinal signs and a subnormal temperature.</p>
						<p>In small animals, there may be oedema of the eyelids and conjunctiva with ulceration of the mouth and muzzle. Cattle may develop neurological signs, following or concurrently with the gastrointestinal episode. Muscular twitching, ataxia, hindlimb paralysis and terminal convulsions are not uncommon.</p>
						<p>Following administration of excessive amounts of the growth promoting organic arsenicals pigs and sheep often develop only neurological signs, such as ataxia, paralysis and blindness. The neurological deficits usually disappear within a few days of withdrawal of the toxic compound, although blindness may persist in some pigs.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Chronic</p>
						<p>Chronic intoxication is rare in domestic animals in New Zealand, as it is more commonly found in heavily industrialised countries with metallurgical operations, or in regions polluted by dust and smoke from furnaces burning a high arsenical containing coal. This type of poisoning is due usually to a combination of factors, including inhalation or ingestion of heavy metal oxides and sulphides and the mechanical action of dust and smoke particles on the digestive and respiratory tract of the animals, rather than just an exposure to arsenic alone. Symptoms associated with this form of poisoning may occur months or years after exposure.</p>
						<p>Chronic arsenical poisoning may appear with non
specific signs such as wasting, unthriftiness, indigestion, weight loss, poor appetite, dry staring coat, brick red mucous membranes, gastrointestinal disturbances and skin lesions. Reproductive disorders (sterility and abortion) have been reported in some regions. Dermatitis as a result of systemic arsenic administration has been reported, but it is not as common as that found in man.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Chronic Arsenical Poisoning of Dogs</p>
						<p>Chronic arsenical poisoning of dogs was once reported regularly in New Zealand. It occurs following contact with inorganic arsenic as seen when dogs have been tied on woolshed floors where pelts have been treated with arsenic trioxide (Peltex).</p>
						<p>Severe necrosis and sloughing of dependent skin such as the elbows, prepuce and sternum occurs. In addition systemic signs of listlessness, anorexia, soft faeces, rough coat, and ulceration of the mucous membranes occurs. Further arsenic is absorbed as a result of the dog licking the inflamed skin areas.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Arsanilic Acid Poisoning</p>
						<p><b>Pigs</b> 
 Signs of poisoning include incoordination, ataxia, apparent blindness, and circling. Affected swine become weak and assume a sitting dog posture. Eventually the pig becomes paralysed but will continue to eat and drink if food and water are available. Toxic effects are frequently reversible if arsanilic acid is immediately withdrawn from the diet.</p>
						<p><b>Poultry</b> 
 The main effect is to cause anorexia and eventual death. Egg production may also be reduced.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Temporary Infertility in Rams and Post Dipping Losses of Sheep</p>
						<p>Seminal degeneration leading to severe but temporary infertility in rams has been reported following dipping, when rams have been over
heated.</p>
						<p>Another reported adverse effect of arsenical dipping in sheep was post
dipping pneumonia. However the majority of animals were poisoned after ingesting the dip, but animals particularly sheep, were also poisoned percutaneously. Generalised toxic levels of arsenic were reached if unshorn sheep were dipped in humid conditions. The slow evaporation and prolonged wetting of the epidermis increased the absorption of arsenic through the skin. Animals dipped off shears often became intoxicated, as arsenic was rapidly absorbed through cuts and wounds. Arsenic is retained in the fleece for long periods of time, so that even after the fleece is washed in cold water, it may still contain high arsenical levels.</p>

						<p>Characteristically, the main lesions resulting from an arsenic intoxication are found in the alimentary tract. The intestinal contents are fluid, foul smelling and may contain shreds of mucosa and blood. The mucosa is rose
red and peels off the muscular layer when gently rubbed. There is desquamation of the horny layer of the mucosa of the fore stomach, especially in the rumen and reticulum, with marked hyperaemia of the underlying lamina propria. Cattle show severe necrosis of the glandular stomach and small intestine. In some animals these areas perforate and in animals which recover, the areas may be apparent as ulcers or scars on the glandular stomach wall. In sheep where skin absorption has taken place extensive skin damage is a feature. The affected area (usually along the back) is red or purple in colour, the wool pulls easily, the skin is tense and swollen and when stretched tears open with blood stained exudation.</p>
						<p>In poultry a fibrinous and haemorrhagic inflammation of all the mucosal membranes and gallbladder are seen. The large intestine contains watery mucoid green faeces.</p>
						<p>The kidneys and liver of all species are swollen and pale and friable.</p>
						<p>Intoxicated pigs have oedema and hyperaemia of the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea causing asphyxia, inflammation of the pharyngeal mucosa, gastroenteritis and often an arsenical dermatitis. Arsanilic acid intoxicated pigs may show bladder distension. Histopathology may include demyelination of peripheral nerves, optic tracts and optic nerves if exposure is prolonged (i.e. 6
10 days).</p>

						<p>In acute and subacute poisoning the history of access to arsenic and the clinical signs may be the most useful diagnostic aids. Chronic poisoning may be difficult to diagnose. The rapid onset of gastrointestinal signs is a key feature. Non
fatal ingestion of arsenic may be determined by urine analysis, since absorbed arsenic is readily excreted via the kidneys. Urine arsenic levels may remain raised for up to 14 days in cattle. If non
soluble arsenical poisoning is suspected, faecal samples should be examined.</p>

The tubular damage may resolve within two weeks following a moderate dose of arsenic. A metabolic acidosis develops in conjunction with a severe nephrotoxicosis. The diagnosis may be confirmed by demonstration of increased levels of arsenic in body tissues.</p>
						<p>The maximum level of arsenic in animal tissue is reached approximately eight hours after ingestion of the poison. Due to the rapid metabolism of arsenic, it is difficult to establish values, which may be considered &quot;normal&quot; levels for arsenic in tissues and body fluids.</p>
						<p>Arsenic poisoning is considered if the arsenic level is greater than 4 mg/kg in the liver and kidney, and if the blood level is more than 0.03mg/100ml. Levels of more than 2mg/kg wet tissue in the kidney and 2.5
5mg/100ml urine is considered to be a significant level for the organic arsenicals. However cattle which have died of arsenical poisoning may have liver levels from 10
70mg/kg and kidney levels from 17
53mg/kg.</p>
						<p>The concentration of arsenic is usually greatest in the liver, but as the intoxication progresses, the renal concentration gradually increases. Arsenic may also be detected in the stomach or rumen contents, urine, blood, spleen, faeces or any altered organs. In chronic intoxications, analysis of hair and skin may be of value. The detection of arsenic in the faeces may be misleading, as the insoluble arsenical compounds may not be causing a clinical problem.</p>
						<p>The Reinsch test is used for analysis and is a rapid, qualitative test. This is supplemented by a quantitative test by which the significance of the presence of arsenic is determined.</p>

						<p>A discussion of the treatment of arsenical poisoning in large animals is largely academic, as most animals are moribund when found. However, the initial treatment for arsenical poisoning is based on protecting the gut mucosa, removing unabsorbed arsenic from the gastrointestinal tract and hastening the elimination of the poison.</p>
						<p>If the route of intoxication was oral and recent, then <a href="treat.html#vomVet">emesis</a> can be induced carefully. The vigorous use of emetics and cathartics is not advised as these may cause the weakened bowel walls to rupture.</p>
						<p>Following emesis, a <a href="treat.html#gasLav">gastric lavage</a> should be attempted using 0.9% sodium chloride solution, magnesium oxide or a colloid of magnesium hydroxide. Repeat the lavage 2 to 3 times.</p>
						<p>Administer <a href="treat.html#demulc">demulcents</a> to protect the injured gastric mucosa. Activated charcoal is indicated if the ingestion is recent. Saline <a href="treat.html#cath">cathartics</a> are not indicated if diarrhoea is present.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Specific <a class="titleTox" href="treat.html#antidChel">antidotes</a>.</p>
						<p><b>Ferric hydroxide</b>. The use of moist, fresh ferric hydroxide was the classical treatment for arsenical poisoning. However, the efficacy of this treatment is doubtful and probably only postpones death.</p>
						<p><b>Sodium thiosulphate</b>, administered intravenously and orally. Horses and cattle may be given orally 20
30g of the salt in about 500mls of water. Repeat 12 hourly, until there is a marked improvement (often for 3
4 days). Give small ruminants about 1/4 of the recommended dose.</p>
						<p>An alternative regime is to give cattle and horses 8
10g as a 10% solution i/v, then 20
30g of thiosulphate in 300mls of water. Repeat six to twelve hourly for three to four days.</p>
						<p>Sheep and goats may be given 2
2.5gm as a 10% solution i/v, followed by 5
6gm in 75mls of water given orally. Sodium thiosulphate needs to be given within 12 hours after exposure to the poison. The toxicity of thiosulphate is very low and can be administered in large doses without precise weighing. Although the therapeutic mechanism of thiosulphate is not known, it is thought to be due to the reaction of the active sulphur molecule of sodium thiosulphate with arsenic, which immobilises the metalloid.</p>
						<p><b>Dimercaprol</b>, or BAL
British Anti Lewisite is a dithiol
containing chelating agent which was developed during the 1939
45 war as an antidote to arsenical gas (lewisite). BAL has shown some usefulness as an antidote to arsenical poisoning in man. Its use in animals has been very limited and unrewarding. As it is frequently mentioned as a treatment for arsenical poisoning the following points are made for academic interest. Theoretically BAL removes arsenic from the inhibited sulphydryl groups of lipoic acid, monothiols, dithiols and enzymes. The BAL and arsenic form relatively non
toxic and easily excretable complexes. In practice, the response to BAL is not dramatic.</p>
						<p>Chelation Doses: Large animal: 3 mg/kg i/m as a 5% solution of BAL in a 10% solution of benzyl benzoate in peanut or arachis oil. Administer every 4 hours for the first two days, every six hours for 3
10 days and then every twelve hours for the next ten days. Administration four hourly initially is very important.</p>
						<p>Small animal: 2.5
5 mg/kg (5mg for severe cases only, on first day) in a 10% solution of BAL in oil. The dosage intervals are the same as above. Renal function should be monitored during treatment.</p>
						<p>If the BAL treatment seems to worsen the animal's condition initially, it may be due to mobilization of stored body arsenic and extra BAL may be required. If the animal starts to worsen after 2
3 days of BAL treatment, then the BAL dose may be too large for the individual animal, with resulting toxicity. Signs of BAL toxicity may include tachycardia, anorexia, vomiting, hypersalivation, fever and seizures.</p>
						<p><b>Mesodimercaptosuccinic acid</b> (DMSA) is probably the chelator of choice for arsenic. At this writing it is not available in New Zealand except from chemical suppliers like BDH or Sigma. It is safer than BAL. The dose has not been fully tested in animals. Rabbits were treated with 30 mg/kg subcutaneously. Humans have been treated effectively with a total dose of 300 mg every 6 hours for 3 days.</p>
						<p><b>Thioctic acid</b> (Sigma Chemical Co or Aldrich Chemical Co) was found to be superior to BAL in calves. Thioctic acid may be used with BAL. A 20% solution of DL
6,8
thioctic acid is administered as a 20% solution. The solution is made by adding 50 grams of Thioctic acid to 100 ml of warm SN NaOH, cooled and pH adjusted to 6.8 to 7.0 with 1N HCL and made up to the 20 % solution with distilled water. The dose is 50 mg/kg IM at 2
3 injection sites every 8 hours.</p>
						<p>Sulphydryl containing compounds, other than BAL, have been shown to protect laboratory animals against arsenical poisoning; presumably by the same mechanism of forming complexes with arsenic. These compounds include lipoic acid, which has been shown to reduce the blood arsenic concentration and improve the clinical condition of poisoned mice and dogs. N
acetylcysteine (Parvolex<span style="font-family: Symbol;">&#150;</span>) decreased the toxicity of sodium arsenite in experimental mice but no clinical evaluation has been done. It has the advantage of intravenous administration for acute toxicity. Cysteine was tried in the treatment of intoxicated beef heifers, but did not have any beneficial effect. Glutathione and other thiols have also been tried with limited success. Antitoxal (Rudduck, Australia) is a general antidote containing methylene blue, which has been recommended. Dimercaptosuccinic acid is thirty times less toxic and is more effective in treating arsenic trioxide fed rats, than BAL. It is effective orally and is relatively nontoxic for dogs.</p>
						<p>Nursing and supportive care is also essential for recovering animals. Sodium chloride (0.9%) fluid may be required to combat dehydration and hypochloraemia and to create an osmotic diuresis to enhance excretion. Blood transfusions, B
vitamins, gut protectants, broadspectrum antibiotics, Vitamin C (up to a gram per day), analgesics, protein hydrolysates, high calorie diets, warmth, quiet and reduced light, have all been advocated. Adrenergic drugs, to promote the peripheral circulation have also been suggested.</p>
						<p class="titleTox">Prevention</p>
						<p>Inorganic arsenical preparations remain toxic indefinitely, so the proper disposal of compounds and their containers is very important.</p>
