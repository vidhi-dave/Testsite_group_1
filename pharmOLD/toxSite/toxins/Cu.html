					<p>Copper compounds are widely used in agriculture and veterinary practice as copper supplements, fungicides, bactericides, molluscicides and anthelmintics and on occasion all these have caused serious poisoning and considerable loss of domestic animals. Copper is an element involved in a number of essential enzyme systems, of which a deficiency can lead to a variety of symptoms in animals. In an attempt to correct some copper deficiency states by various types of supplementation, copper toxicity has resulted.</p>
					<p>Sheep and young calves are most susceptible to copper poisoning but adult cattle, goats, deer and pigs are all affected. Horses, dogs and cats are susceptible to copper poisoning and one particular breed of dog, the Bedlington terrier exhibits a genetically
linked liver storage disease which leads to copper poisoning.</p>

					<p>The terms primary and secondary copper poisoning and acute and chronic copper poisoning are regularly used. In all cases an acute crisis results which is usually fatal but because the aetiology is complex it is useful to adhere to these terms when describing copper toxicity.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Primary copper poisoning</p>
					<p>This usually results from overdosage with a copper compound, particularly soluble copper salts e.g. copper sulphate. Sheep, cattle, pigs and even dogs and cats may be affected in this manner.</p>
					<p>The copper may be incorporated into:</p>
					<p>i.<b> Salt licks</b> 
 Mineral salt blocks are frequently used in New Zealand farms and along with other added minerals may contain up to 5% of soluble copper salts.</p>
					<p>ii.<b> Plant sprays</b> such as Bordeaux mixture, which is a fungicidal spray containing up to 3% of copper sulphate. This is still regularly used in some orchards and private gardens.</p>
					<p>iii.<b> Copper in drinking water.</b> Mainly used as copper sulphate. This has not been popular in New Zealand but the advent of mineral dispensers may increase its use. There are overseas reports of copper poisoning of cattle when the piping used to the troughs was made from copper (rare inNZ).</p>
					<p>iv.<b> Stock pellets and poultry mashes etc.</b> These by accident sometimes contain high levels of copper. Normally stock food should not contain more than 10
15 mg/kg dry matter of copper. Not infrequently much higher levels than these have been reported and this has been attributed to high copper levels in the protein part of the ration in addition to added copper salts. Even with low or normal levels of copper poisoning may occur if inhibiting factors to the uptake and storage of copper are low or absent from the diet e.g. molybdenum and sulphate.</p>
					<p>v.<b> Injectable copper medicaments</b> when overdosed or given to animals with an already high level of copper can lead to primary copper poisoning. Included are copper glycinate (Copperplan) and copper calcium edetate (Coprin).</p>
					<p>Copper poisoning occasionally follows copper medication in sheep because of the wide variation in storage levels of individuals within the flock. This has been recorded following the use of all the above materials although copper calcium edetate and copper glycinate are slow release forms of copper and therefore are considered safer.</p>
					<p>Old drenches such as bluestone and nicotine sulphate and copper sulphate and copper arsenate are rarely used today. Copper dioxide needles and glass bullets used to prevent copper deficiency are probably unlikely to lead to copper poisoning because of their very slow release and absorption.</p>
					<p>vi. The regular use of <b>mineral mixes</b> added to anthelmintic drenches has led to copper toxicosis in sheep. Hence, all such drenches have a warning label which emphasises the susceptibitilty of sheep to copper poisoning.</p>
					<p>vii. <b>Topdressing</b> of pastures with copper salts has led to copper poisoning. Frequently losses have occurred in sheep returned to topdressed paddocks before the copper salts have been washed from the leaves of grass and topsoil by adequate rain. Copper topdressed pastures should not be used for at least 3 weeks unless 5mm of rain has fallen. Copper topdressing is used less nowadays because of the cost and there are more effective means of supplementing copper to deficient animals. It also was assumed that cattle and sheep on the same farm required the same amounts of copper. This is not so and frequently in many New Zealand farms sheep are copper sufficient while cattle only are at risk of deficiency. Recent and extensive studies in Otago and Southland have exposed the high liver levels of copper frequently reported in grazing lambs. These have been associated with low pasture molybdenum, grazing paddocks recently topdressed with copper sulphate, supplementing with mineralised drenches and copperised licks, and the high copper content of chicory. Liver copper concentration of over 3000 umol/kg on a wet matter basis have been reported. These levels tended to be seasonal mainly in autumn.</p>
					<p>viii. <b>Copper sulphate</b> as a footrot treatment is no longer popular so that risk from this source is unlikely.</p>
					<p>ix. <b>Copper poisoning</b> of calves fed milk substitute is frequently reported. This may be a combination of high levels of copper in newborn calf livers plus the addition of copper to the milk substitute.</p>
					<p>x. <b>Copper poisoning</b> of pigs has also resulted from the addition of extra copper to their diets. Copper has frequently been used for pigs for its growth stimulating effect. Some pig supplements have contained dangerously high levels of copper e.g. above 200 mg/kg.</p>
					<p>Primary copper poisoning can result from all the above sources of copper, an acute poisoning usually results from a single and usually excessive overdose while chronic poisoning results from the accumulative effects of small doses over a period. The terminal disease is however an acute intoxication as described below.</p>
					<p class="sgH3"><b>Secondary copper poisoning</b></p>
					<p>For convenience this is referred to as phytogenous secondary copper poisoning and hepatogenous secondary copper poisoning.</p>
					<p>i.<b> Phytogenous copper poisoning</b> 
 This is particularly common in sheep where feed factors cause the slow accumulation of copper in the liver until a crisis level is reached. Some stress factor then causes the sudden release of copper which leads to massive intravascular haemolysis and death from asphyxiation. Phytogenous copper poisoning may result from the uptake of copper from plants and soils with a higher than normal level. Such soils exist in Australia and New Zealand. Normally soil contains about 20 mg/kg of copper and herbage about 8
12 mg/kg under average New Zealand conditions. Plants such as subterranean clover (trifolium subterraneum) favour the accumulation of copper and the absorption of copper from leafy brassicas is also high.</p>
					<p>However the uptake and storage of copper is complex and depends not only on the level of copper in either soil or pasture but also on other inhibiting factors which control its storage. The two essential factors are molybdenum and sulphur (as sulphate). The sulphate is reduced by rumen microflora to sulphide which then reacts with molybdate to form thiomolybdates which in turn combine with copper to form insoluble copper thiomolybdates. The thiomolybdates in the rumen make dietary copper unavailable for absorption and the excess becomes absorbed into the blood stream where it mobilises tissue copper for subsequent excretion in the urine.</p>
					<p>Other elements such as iron, manganese and zinc also may affect the uptake of copper from pasture and feed.</p>
					<p>In addition hereditary factors influence the storage of sheep markedly. This has been shown in some breeds such as the kelp eating sheep of the Hebridean Islands which are very prone to copper poisoning in normal pasture. Conversely the Scottish blackface is very susceptible to copper depletion.</p>
					<p>There is no information on inheritance of copper storage ability in New Zealand sheep.</p>
					<p>ii.<b> Hepatogenous secondary copper poisoning </b><b>
 </b>In hepatogenous copper poisoning of sheep, their livers are damaged by plant toxins and the normal excretion of copper in the bile is depressed and liver storage increases to dangerously high levels. This condition is most commonly seen following the grazing of <i>Heliotropium europaeum</i>, Ragwort or Senecio spp. which is very common in New Zealand and Australia and <i>Echium plantagineum</i>, blue borage or Patterson's curse. The latter is frequently seen in the drier areas of both islands of New Zealand. These plants contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids which produce liver damage, cirrhosis and atrophy. This type of copper poisoning was formerly referred to as toxaemic jaundice.</p>
					<p>The effects of these plants are cumulative and grazing for one season may cause little harm but further grazing in subsequent years may result in heavy mortality.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Copper toxicosis of Bedlington terriers</p>
					<p>A specific form of clinical copper poisoning occurs in Bedlington terriers. The disease is an inherited liver dysfunction of lysosome clearance. Poisoned dogs can store up to 50 times normal levels of copper. The disease is often manifested later in life as a focal hepatitis leading to a chronic active hepatitis and ultimately liver cirrhosis and death. The disease can be confirmed by liver biopsy.</p>
					<p>It is estimated that 65% of the 6000 - 8000 Bedlington terriers in the USA have high copper concentrations in their livers. The disease is similar in cause and character to Wilson's disease of humans.</p>

					</table>
					<p>The terminal features of chronic copper toxicity from whatever cause are a severe haemolytic crisis with a massive destruction of erythrocytes leading to death from asphyxiation.</p>
					<p>Prior to blood haemolysis most liver parenchymal cells are damaged and there is considerable leakage of both hepatic enzymes and copper into the circulation. Blood levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) indicate hepatic necrosis and can be readily detected in blood prior to the haemolytic crisis. Serum or plasma liver enzymes may increase 3
6 weeks before the haemolytic crisis. Other prodromal blood changes include a marked elevation of the packed cell volume (PCV).</p>
					<p>Blood copper concentrations rise quickly and within 48 hours they may have risen to 10 times the normal concentration. Sometimes a &quot;mild crisis&quot; occurs without visible haemolysis and haematuria but this will be followed after a few days by a severe second event having a fatal outcome.</p>
					<p>The pronounced increase in blood copper leads to erythrocyte lysis and the release of haemoglobin and methaemoglobin into the plasma. The blood becomes chocolate
brown in colour. Heinz bodies appear in up to 90% of the erythrocytes and free Heinz bodies are seen in plasma. The erythrocytes collapse, appear crenated and are left as ghost cells.</p>
					<p>The massive destruction of blood components leads to the accumulation of copper in the remaining liver cells which are severely damaged and kidney function ceases as a result of haemoglobin toxicity. Haematuria and haemoglobinuria occur relatively early in the syndrome.</p>

					<p>Pigs</p>
					<p>Marginal levels of zinc and iron in the diet can predispose growing pigs to the toxic effects of copper given at levels which are normally recommended in the diet (up to 180 mg/kg). At these levels liver and kidney copper levels may rise to more than 63000 and 15700 umol/kg (4000 and 1000 ppm) respectively within 4
14 weeks of supplementation. Necropsy of such pigs may disclose jaundice, anaemia, gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage and a yellow
ochre or bronzed fibrotic liver and bronzed kidneys. There is however little or no evidence of haemolytic jaundice as in sheep and cattle.</p>
					<p>The cause of death in pigs in chronic copper poisoning is considered to be due mainly to anaemia and/or sudden or progressive loss of blood through haemorrhage into the alimentary tract.</p>

					<p>The most valuable tissues for confirmation of copper poisoning are liver and kidney.

					<p class="sgH3">Food Examination</p>
					<p>With all species it is essential to examine the diet in chronic copper poisoning. The food should be analysed for copper, molybdenum and sulphur. This, as with copper deficiency may assist in preventing further occurrences of the situation. This procedure is particularly important with outbreaks of copper poisoning in grazing sheep and in animals which are housed and fed supplement.</p>
					<p>It is recommended that a good selection of paddocks be tested. If different soil types are present, the pasture from these should be included.</p>

					<p>Symptomatic treatment should be applied as for other metallic poisoning. Chelating agents such as D
penicillamine (10
15 mg/kg twice daily, PO), DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) or BAL (British anti lewisite) have been recommended. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used in small animals to enhance the urinary excretion of copper (500
1000 mg daily).</p>
					<p>D<b>
</b>penicillamine has been used to treat Wilson's disease in humans and Bedlington terriers. Since the disease is inherited and progressive in dogs its use is ethically questionable.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Acute toxicity of Ruminants and Swine</p>
					<p>With ruminants and pigs, once symptoms appear the prognosis is poor. For animals that may respond to treatment the following is suggested:</p>urinary copper excretion is increased 10
20 times by D
penicillamine. 50 mg/kg/day for 6 days, but it is expensive.<p>Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, 1.7
3.4 mg/sheep/every other day for 3 days (intravenous), aids in rapid binding and excretion of copper.</p>
					<p>However it should be recognised that when losses have occurred, other animals in the flock are at risk, many may have toxic storage levels of copper and treatment of these animals may be beneficial.</p>
					<p class="sgH3">Chronic toxicity of Ruminants and Swine</p>
					<p>Every effort should be made to prevent further deaths depending on the value of the animals, size of the flock and other circumstances and the recommended management is as follows:</p>
					<p>Move quietly to new grazing. Some parts of the farm may have pastures of lower copper content e.g. less clover.</p>
					<p>Avoid stress.</p>
					<p>Oral treatment with 100mg ammonium molybdate plus 1 gram anhydrous sodium sulphate in 10ml of water daily will significantly reduce stored liver levels of copper.</p>
					<p>In the case of supplemented animals the same ingredients may be added to the feed. Note however that high sulphur levels may affect the palatability of the feed.</p>
					<p>check other sheep, calves etc for AST levels

Spraying of hay with molybdenum and sulphur may also be possible.
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>If you are dealing with valuable animals a small group of sentinels which can be liver biopsied from time to time may be useful to check the effects of topdressing and other long term therapy.
