					<p>There is a wide range of herbicides and other materials used frequently on farms and in suburban gardens which in general are of low mammalian toxicity but may on occasion be considered in unusual toxicoses.&nbsp; In some countries such materials have unwittingly become the cause of extensive ill health and death to both human and animals.&nbsp; Such losses have occurred through the use of chlorinated phenols and polybrominated biphenyls, among others.</p>
					<p>Herbicide sprays may contain mixtures of several chemicals.&nbsp; They usually contain some sort of detergent or wetting agent, and often a silicone penetrant, as well as the active ingredient. Most modern compounds are much safer than old ones, but stocks of the older toxic weedkillers are often seen at the backs of sheds.</p>
					<p>Most poisonings are associated with carelessness although occasionally malicious poisoning occurs.</p>
					<p>With herbicides in particular, the risk to those involved in their preparation is obvious.&nbsp; In addition care must be taken in their use that there is no spray drift to food and water nor the careless disposal of containers, particularly in waterways.</p>
					<p>Although the herbicides are seldom used in sufficient concentration to cause direct harm, some do remain toxic after affecting the plants and others render poisonous plants more palatable.</p>
					<p>When ingested by animals at toxic levels, herbicides generally produce anorexia, gastro
intestinal disturbances and toxic effects on liver and kidneys.&nbsp; The central nervous system may also be affected.</p>
					<p>The Novachem manual (published annually) contains details of all the plant protection products in NZ. The <a href="http://www.artlink.co.nz/agrichem/index.asp">NZ Agrichemical Manual</a> covers agricultural herbicides, inscticides and additives. The <a href="http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/acvm/registers-lists/acvm-register/index.htm">ACVM database</a> is the definitive list of plant products in NZ, but does not contain many details.</p>
