					<p>ANTU was once a commonly used rodenticide and although it is no longer commercially available in NZ, some of this poison may still be found on farms.&nbsp; ANTU is a white powder when pure, but the commercial form is grey.&nbsp; It is insoluble in water, has very little taste or smell, and as a bait is usually mixed with grain into a mash.&nbsp; Rats which survive an initial exposure to ANTU usually become bait shy.</p>

					<p>Individual species vary markedly in their susceptibility to ANTU (Table 31).&nbsp; As a rodenticide, it is only effective against the brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>).</p>
					<p>Domestic poultry are almost completely resistant to ANTU poisoning, so it is a safe poison to use in fowl runs.</p>
					<p>Many factors affect the toxicity of the ingested dose of ANTU. These factors include the animal's age (as the age increases the susceptibility increases); the amount of food in the stomach; the particle size of ANTU (the larger the particle size, the greater the toxicity) and ingestion of small quantities over days so that a tolerance develops which takes several weeks to disappear once the exposure is stopped.</p>

					<p>ANTU is rapidly absorbed from the gut, which leads to clinical signs of intoxication within one hour.&nbsp; It is rapidly metabolised and quickly eliminated from the body.&nbsp; ANTU causes emesis in dogs which ingest the compound, by central and local effects.&nbsp; The gastric mucosa irritation is reduced if there is food in the stomach, so that more of the substance is absorbed.</p>
					<p>ANTU exerts its toxic effect by increasing the permeability of the lung capillaries, so that the leakage of fluid exceeds the drainage capacity of the lymphatics.&nbsp; The exact mechanism causing this effect is not known, but it may be a result of a short circuiting of the blood vessel vasoconstriction, which is mediated through the sympathetic system.</p>

					<p>The onset of clinical signs is rapid.&nbsp; Within a few minutes to hours vomition and salivation are seen followed by pulmonary oedema within 2 hours.&nbsp; Dyspnoea, moist rales, frothy mucous, coughing, short rapid respiration and cyanosis are seen as the intoxication progresses.&nbsp; Muted heart sounds, tachycardia, reduced body temperature, coma and death from anoxia are seen.</p>
					<p>Affected animals usually die within 6 to 8 hours but if they survive for 12 hours then the prognosis is good.</p>

					<p>On necropsy the lungs are wet and heavy, due to the pulmonary oedema and there is usually fluid within the chest cavity and pericardium.&nbsp; The arterial blood is dark due to the anoxic state and there is hyperaemia of the trachea, bronchi, gastro
intestinal mucosa, liver and kidneys, and haemorrhages on the myocardium.</p>The excessive fluid secretion accumulates in the respiratory airways and becomes agitated to a froth by the respiratory movements.&nbsp; These factors block the gaseous exchange, and the animal drowns in its own body fluids, usually within 6
48 hours.<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

					Pulmonary oedema and cyanosis result in the characteristic hydrothorax.&nbsp; Fluid may be poured from the bronchi and trachea of affected animals.&nbsp; The liver and kidneys are hyperaemic.
					<p>The samples for tissue analysis (gut, liver) need to be taken within 24 hours of ingestion of a fairly large quantity of poison.&nbsp; If the animal survives longer than 24 hours, the chemical tests will be negative.&nbsp; Any ANTU detected in the tissues is diagnostically significant.</p>

					<p>There is no specific or reliable treatment and the prognosis is&nbsp; poor once pulmonary oedema has developed.&nbsp; If the poison has been ingested within the last 2 - 3 hours <a href="../treat.html#vomVet">emetics</a> or <a href="../treat.html#gasLav">gastric lavage</a> may be administered to reduce any further absorption. Activated charcoal or other treatments, except liquid paraffin or oils, aimed at emptying the gastrointestinal tract should be used. Experimental work indicates that providing thiol groups may reduce mortality. N acetyl cysteine provides thiol groups and is available from most hospital pharmacies. Barbiturates may be used, to sedate or anaesthetise the animal, to reduce the tissue demand for oxygen.&nbsp; The animal should be placed on an incline with the head downwards and the chest periodically compressed to aid the drainage of fluid from the bronchi.&nbsp; Maintain the body temperature by means of an electric blanket, and administer intermittent positive pressure ventilation with oxygen if required.</p>
					<p>The use of adrenolytic agents to dilate pulmonary vessels and to relieve pulmonary arterial hypertension; and an osmotic diuretic (mannitol) are recommended.&nbsp;The use of silicone aerosols has also been suggested as they may reduce the formation of froth within the bronchioles.</p>
