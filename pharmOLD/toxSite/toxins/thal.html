					<p>Thallium poisoning or thallotoxicosis is unknown as a cause of poisoning in domestic animals in NZ.&nbsp; However the widespread use of this metal in overseas countries, particularly Europe and the USA led to many cases of human and canine poisoning.&nbsp; Cats have also been poisoned. Because of the severe nature of poisoning by thallium, mention is made of it in this text.</p>

					<p>The element was used extensively as a rodenticide, particularly in the United States.&nbsp; It has also been used as an insecticide.&nbsp; Its use was banned in that country in 1965 but cases of thallium poisoning in dogs are still reported.</p>
					<p>Thallium has also been used medicinally as thallium sulphate for the treatment of syphilis, gonorrhoea, gout, dysentery and tuberculosis.&nbsp; It has been used as a depilator and for the treatment of ringworm.</p>
					<p>In industry, thallium is used to manufacture imitation jewellery and optical lenses.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Human illness has been recorded with all these uses, but in dogs and cats the main source has been the accidental ingestion of rodenticides.</p>

					<p>Soluble thallium salts are rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastro intestinal tract, including the oral cavity.&nbsp; After absorption thallium is dispersed widely to all tissues.&nbsp; Most thallium is found in the kidneys but storage persists and excretion from the animal is slow, resulting in accumulation.&nbsp; It is excreted mainly in the urine but is also found in the faeces, milk, sweat and tears.</p>

sodium ion mediated functions.</p>

					<p>The severity of the symptoms depend on the size of the dose.&nbsp; Large doses lead to the following clinical picture:</p>
					<p><b>&nbsp;Acute</b> 
 severe gastrointestinal irritation with vomiting, and haemorrhagic diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain and anorexia; severe dyspnoea; tremors, ataxia and paralysis with death occurring within a week.</p>
					<p><b>Sub acute</b> 
 Vomiting and paresis occurring within 3
7 days after ingestion of the thallium, typical skin changes also appear.&nbsp; These include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Progressive erythema, scaliness, alopecia, bleeding and secondary infection beginning at the commissures of the mouth and eyes and spreading to other parts of the body, even to the foot pads.
						<li>Often there is a purulent conjunctivitis and blepharitis.&nbsp; These features are common in cats.
						<li>Oral mucosal ulcers are common and the mucosa may be a brick red or mahogany coloured.
						<li> The initial gastrointestinal signs and skin lesions are followed by nervous signs characterised by hyperaesthesia, resistance to handling, spasticity and pain on palpation.&nbsp; There is loss of the righting reflex and muscle coordination leading to emaciation, coma and death.

					<p>In acutely affected animals there is a severe haemorrhagic gastroenteritis, bronchitis, and focal degeneration and necrosis of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibres.&nbsp; There is hepatic necrosis and nephrosis of the kidney.</p>
					<p>In less acute cases skin hyperaemia with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and dyskeratosis of the epithelium and hair follicles.</p>
					<p>Confirmation of thallium poisoning is made by analysis of urine and/or tissues in the dead animal.</p>

					<p>Orally administered Prussian blue&nbsp;is the preferred treatment for enhancing the elimination from thallium poisoned animals. Activated charcoal to adsorb thallium in the GI tract with Prussian blue have been used successfully in humans. Forced diuresis is a helpful additional treatment. The dose of Prussian blue used in humans is 1000 mg every 8 hours for up to 3 weeks depending on severity.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;Animal studies indicate that the concurrent use of D
penicillamine&nbsp;(25 mg/kg IP every twelve hours) with Prussian blue (50 mg/kg PO every 12 hours) improves the survivability of rats poisoned with various doses of thallium. However, D
penicillamine should not be used alone as it appears to cause a redistribution of thallium and a poorer survivability.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;In spite of the best treatment possible the mortality rate from thallium poisoning is high (60%) and severe debility frequently occurs in apparently recovered animals.&nbsp; Other treatment is along the well
known lines for heavy metal toxicity, including the use of BAL, sodium thiosulphate and various chelating agents.&nbsp; Symptomatic treatment including blood transfusion and fluid therapy are essential.</p>
